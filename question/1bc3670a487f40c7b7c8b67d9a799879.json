  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Struct: BurnchainOpSigner] [Key Usage] Is the same private key used for multiple types of burnchain operations (commits, key registrations, transfers), potentially violating key separation principles? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [Identity Binding] Is the derived public key properly bound to a specific Stacks address or miner identity to prevent key substitution attacks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: sign_message()] [DoS] Can an attacker repeatedly call sign_message() with invalid inputs to consume CPU resources on expensive ECDSA signature operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: get_public_key()] [DoS] Since public key derivation recomputes on every call, can an attacker repeatedly invoke this to waste CPU on elliptic curve operations? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: get_secret_key_as_wif()] [DoS] Can repeated WIF export operations cause excessive heap allocations or string processing overhead, degrading node performance? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Tests] [Coverage] Are there tests verifying that disposed signers properly reject all operations (not just sign_message), including get_public_key, get_secret_key_as_wif, and get_secret_key_as_hex? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Tests] [Coverage] Are there tests for concurrent access patterns where multiple threads call sign_message() or dispose() simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Tests] [Coverage] Are there tests verifying that private key material is not leaked through Debug output, error messages, or panic backtraces? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Tests] [Coverage] Are there tests for edge cases like signing the maximum allowed message hash (all 0xFF bytes) or the minimum (all 0x00 bytes)? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Tests] [Coverage] Are there tests verifying WIF encoding for all possible private key values, including edge cases near the secp256k1 curve order? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: sign_message()] [Signature Format] Does the returned MessageSignature use recoverable ECDSA (with recovery ID) or standard ECDSA, and does this match burnchain verification expectations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: sign_message()] [Signature Format] Are signatures produced in DER format, compact format, or another encoding, and is this consistent with Bitcoin script verification for burnchain operations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: sign_message()] [Signature Malleability] Does the signature generation use low-S normalization to prevent signature malleability attacks as required by Bitcoin consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: get_secret_key_as_wif()] [Key Export] Are there any restrictions on when or how often this function can be called, or can key export happen at any time without authorization? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: get_secret_key_as_hex()] [Key Export] Should hex export be restricted to specific administrative operations or debugging scenarios rather than being freely accessible? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/operations.rs] [Function: new()] [Key Import] Are there any restrictions on importing keys from external sources, or does the constructor accept any Secp256k1PrivateKey regardless of origin? (Medium)"
