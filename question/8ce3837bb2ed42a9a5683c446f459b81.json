  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_block_processed_payload()] [PoX Constants] The PoX unlock heights (v1, v2, v3) are included at lines 394-396 - are these values validated to be monotonically increasing and non-zero before inclusion in events? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_block_processed_payload()] [Tenure Height] The coinbase_height is labeled as tenure_height at line 400 - could confusion between block height, coinbase height, and tenure height cause incorrect reward distribution tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_block_processed_payload()] [Nakamoto Signature Fields] For Nakamoto blocks (lines 406-419), signer_signature_hash, miner_signature, and signer_signature are added conditionally - if any of these serializations fail with unwrap_or_default(), could this hide invalid signatures that should fail validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_burn_block_payload()] [FATAL Serialization] The expect() call at line 234 will panic with \\",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_burn_block_payload()] [Reward Amount Validation] The function accepts rewards as Vec<(PoxAddress, u64)> and burns as u64 (lines 211-213) - are these amounts validated to not exceed total BTC committed, or could overflow in u64 addition cause incorrect burn reporting? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_burn_block_payload()] [Address Cloning] PoxAddress is cloned multiple times (lines 223-224, 228) - if PoxAddress contains large data structures or version-specific fields, could this cloning introduce errors? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_burn_block_payload()] [Slot Holder Validation] The slot_holders Vec<PoxAddress> is included without validation (line 228) - could duplicate addresses or invalid PoX addresses in this list cause reward distribution errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_burn_block_payload()] [Parent Hash Consistency] The parent_burn_block_hash is included (line 231) - is there validation that this hash correctly links to the previous burn block, or could chain reorgs cause inconsistent parent references? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_mempool_txs_payload()] [Transaction Serialization] The function serializes transactions using serialize_to_vec() and wraps in to_hex_prefixed() (line 202) - could transactions with ambiguous encodings produce different hex representations, causing mempool inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_mempool_txs_payload()] [Unbounded Array] The function creates a JSON array from all input transactions without size limits (lines 200-205) - could a large number of mempool transactions cause memory exhaustion or serialization DoS?

  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_mempool_txs_payload()] [Hex Prefix Parameter] The to_hex_prefixed() call uses true for the prefix parameter (line 202) - is this",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_attachment_payload()] [Index Validation] The attachment_index is included directly from AttachmentInstance (line 306) - could duplicate or out-of-order indices cause incorrect attachment tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_attachment_payload()] [Content Size] The attachment content is hex-encoded without size validation (line 313) - could extremely large attachments (approaching max transaction size) cause DoS when serialized to hex, doubling memory usage? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_attachment_payload()] [Hash Formatting] Multiple fields use format!() with 0x prefix (lines 307-312) - could format errors or non-UTF8 data in hashes cause malformed JSON? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: make_new_attachment_payload()] [Contract ID Format] The contract_id is formatted as a string (line 310) - is this consistent with contract ID representation elsewhere, and could principal/name parsing differences cause mismatches?

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: MinedMicroblockEvent] [Sequence Ordering] The sequence field is u16 (line 66) - could microblock sequences wrap around after 65535, causing ordering issues, or is there validation preventing this? (Medium)",

  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: MinedNakamotoBlockEvent] [Signature Validation] The miner_signature field (line 81) is a MessageSignature - is this signature validated against miner_signature_hash before event emission, or could invalid signatures be propagated?
