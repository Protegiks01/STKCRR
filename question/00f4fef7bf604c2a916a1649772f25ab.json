  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Edge Case: All Zeros] If data consists entirely of zero bytes, could this produce a weak checksum that's easier to forge? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Edge Case: All Ones] Similar to all zeros, could all-ones data (0x1F repeatedly) cause checksum weaknesses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Edge Case: Single Byte] How does bit conversion handle single-byte inputs? Could padding be applied incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Performance: Allocation] Multiple functions allocate Strings and Vecs. Could repeated encoding/decoding in a loop cause memory exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Performance: Large Inputs] How does the code scale with very large data inputs (e.g., megabytes)? Could this be a DoS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Memory: Vec Capacity] When building vectors incrementally, are capacity hints used to avoid repeated reallocations? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Crypto: Checksum Strength] The Bech32 checksum is designed to detect errors. What is the error detection rate, and could an attacker forge checksums with reasonable probability? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Crypto: Collision Resistance] Could two different data payloads produce the same bech32 encoding, creating address collision vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Crypto: Preimage Attacks] Given a bech32 string, could an attacker find alternative data that produces the same encoding? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Determinism: Encoding] Is the encoding process fully deterministic across all platforms, architectures, and Rust versions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Determinism: Decoding] Does decoding always produce the same result for the same input, or could platform differences cause divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Determinism: Error Handling] Are errors deterministic, or could non-deterministic error paths cause consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Interop: Bitcoin Compatibility] If Stacks uses bech32 similar to Bitcoin, are there compatibility concerns with different implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Interop: Version Differences] Could different versions of this module produce incompatible encodings, requiring a hard fork to fix? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Function: encode()] [No Length Limit] The doc comment at line 491 states no length limits are enforced. Could extremely long data cause issues in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bech32/mod.rs] [Function: decode()] [HRP Lowercase] Line 514 returns hrp_lower in lowercase. Could this cause issues if original case information is needed? (Low)"
