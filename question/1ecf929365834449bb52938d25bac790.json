  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Struct: GetStackersRequestHandler] [State Mutation] The handler uses Option<u64> for cycle_number on line 36 - can concurrent request handling cause race conditions where cycle_number is set by one request but read by another? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Nakamoto Transition] The function calls read_reward_set_nakamoto() on line 99 - what happens if the requested cycle_number is from pre-Nakamoto epoch but PoX-4 is active, could this cause incorrect reward set retrieval or mixing of epoch data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Signer Set Validation] Since this is a Nakamoto-specific endpoint (v3), does it validate that the returned reward set contains valid signer public keys and that signer weights sum correctly for consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Information Disclosure] The metrics identifier on line 117 is '/v3/stacker_set/:cycle_num' - can an attacker use timing analysis of metrics endpoints to determine which cycle numbers are queried most frequently and infer stacking behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Future Cycles] Can an attacker request reward sets for future cycles (cycle_number > current_cycle) before the prepare phase starts, and will the NotAvailableYet error leak information about when future cycles will activate? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Historical Cycles] For very old cycle numbers (e.g., cycle 0 or 1), does the endpoint properly handle historical reward sets that may have been pruned or are not available in the database, or could this cause database errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] What happens if cycle_num_str from captures.name() on line 135 is the maximum u64 value '18446744073709551615' - will from_str_radix() accept it, but subsequent calculations overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [API Consistency] Does this endpoint return the same reward set structure and data as other PoX-related endpoints, or could inconsistencies between endpoints cause clients to receive conflicting stacker information? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tip Consistency] The tip is loaded using TipRequest from query parameters - if another endpoint uses a different tip loading mechanism, can this cause inconsistent reward set views across API endpoints? (Medium)"
