  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: cost_nft_burn()] [Cost Consistency] Why does nft_burn have identical cost formula to nft_transfer (linear n u9 u572)? Should burning not be different from transferring? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: poison_microblock()] [Cost Model Validation] Is the high constant cost u17485 for poison_microblock justified? What expensive operations does microblock poisoning require - signature verification, fork detection, or reward calculation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: poison_microblock()] [Consensus-Critical Cost] With write_count u1 and read_count u1, does poison_microblock adequately account for all state modifications? Could microblock poisoning affect multiple data structures that are not reflected in I/O counts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: cost_buff_to_int_le()] [Cost Model Error] Why are all buffer-to-integer conversions (cost_buff_to_int_le, cost_buff_to_uint_le, cost_buff_to_int_be, cost_buff_to_uint_be) constant u141 regardless of buffer size n? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: cost_buff_to_uint_be()] [Cost Underestimation] Could converting large buffers to integers consume more CPU than the constant u141 cost accounts for, enabling DoS through many large buffer conversions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-3.clar] [Function: cost_is_standard()] [Cost Model Error] Is constant u127 for is_standard principal checking adequate? Could checking standard principal format require parsing variable-length addresses? (Low)"
