  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker craft an IPv4 octet value that parses successfully as u8 but results in an unexpected prefix value after u32::from_be_bytes conversion, potentially causing ASN misclassification? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Integer Overflow] Can providing an ASN value at the u32::MAX boundary (4294967295) cause integer overflow issues in downstream code that performs arithmetic on the asn field, leading to incorrect peer classification? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Input Validation] The mask validation restricts values to 8-24, but can an attacker exploit boundary conditions at mask=8 or mask=24 to create overlapping or conflicting prefix ranges that cause non-deterministic ASN lookups? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Parsing Bypass] Can an attacker craft an IP address with leading zeros (e.g., '001.002.003.004/24') that bypasses the regex but parses differently than expected, causing ASN lookup inconsistencies across nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Input Validation] What happens if the prefix octets don't align with the mask boundary (e.g., '192.168.1.1/8' where the last octets should be zero)? Can this create ambiguous or overlapping prefix matches? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [DoS - Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker provide an unbounded ASN file with millions of valid entries causing the asn4 vector to grow without limit, exhausting node memory and causing crashes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [DoS - CPU Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a file with entries that cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex patterns, leading to exponential parsing time and CPU exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [DoS - Infinite Loop] If the file doesn't end with a newline or EOF marker, can the read_line loop hang indefinitely waiting for data, causing the node to become unresponsive? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [DoS - File Handle Leak] If File::open succeeds but subsequent parsing fails, is the file handle properly closed, or can repeated failed parsing attempts exhaust file descriptors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [DoS - Algorithmic Complexity] The sort_by operation on line 89 has O(n log n) complexity. Can an attacker provide a file with entries in reverse order to maximize sorting time and delay node startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Consensus Divergence] The sorting on line 89 uses prefix.cmp(). If two entries have identical prefixes but different masks or ASNs, what is the sort order? Can this create non-deterministic ASN databases across nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Consensus Divergence] If the file contains duplicate prefix entries with different ASN values, which one is selected? Can nodes with different file processing timing select different ASNs for the same prefix? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Parsing Inconsistency] The regex allows arbitrary whitespace (spaces and tabs) between fields. Can different whitespace characters cause parsing differences between systems with different locale settings? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Error Handling] When parsing fails on line 67-70, the code logs a warning but continues parsing. If multiple lines fail, only the last line number is reported. Can this cause silent acceptance of partially corrupted ASN data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Race Condition] If the ASN file is modified during parsing (between File::open and reading lines), can this cause inconsistent or corrupted ASN data to be loaded? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Parsing Bypass] The regex requires 4 dot-separated octets, but can Unicode lookalike characters (e.g., '․' U+2024 instead of '.' U+002E) bypass the regex and cause parsing failures in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Integer Parsing] When parsing octets on line 167, can negative numbers (e.g., '-1') pass the regex but fail parsing in unexpected ways, or can they wrap around to create valid u8 values on some platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Input Validation] The mask must be 8-24, but can a mask value of 0 or 32 slip through if the parse succeeds but the validation is bypassed, causing incorrect prefix matching? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Buffer Overflow] The read_line function on line 103 reads into buf_full without a size limit. Can an attacker provide an extremely long line (e.g., 1GB) to cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Unicode Handling] If the input file contains non-ASCII Unicode characters in comments or whitespace, can this cause the trim() operation to behave unexpectedly or expose parsing vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Error Handling] The parsed flag is set to false on line 69 but the loop continues. Can an attacker craft a file where the first N lines are valid but line N+1 fails, causing the function to reject all N valid entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [State Inconsistency] If an error occurs after some entries are pushed to asn4 vec but before sorting, what state is returned? Can this cause partially initialized ASN databases? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Error Handling] When DeserializeError occurs on lines 120-125, the inspect_err closure logs but doesn't prevent the error. Can repeated error logging be exploited for log flooding attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Error Handling] File::open errors are mapped to FilesystemError, losing the original error context. Can this make it impossible to distinguish between 'file not found' and 'permission denied', causing incorrect error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Error Path] If the regex captures succeed but parsing of individual fields fails, are all error paths properly handled without leaving the reader in an inconsistent state? (Medium)"
