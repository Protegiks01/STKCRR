  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: find_next_push_block()] [Block Withholding] If find_next_push_block() fails to load a block due to database error but returns None silently, can an attacker exploit this to prevent anti-entropy block propagation without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: find_next_push_microblocks()] [Fork Confusion] When loading microblocks with load_processed_microblock_stream_fork(), if multiple forks exist for the same parent block, can the wrong fork be selected and pushed, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: try_push_local_data_epoch2x()] [DoS - Push Flooding] Can an attacker trigger excessive try_push_local_data_epoch2x() calls by rapidly changing their inventory to show missing blocks, causing the node to exceed max_block_push limits and exhaust bandwidth? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: try_push_local_data_epoch2x()] [Timestamp Manipulation] In antientropy tracking, blocks are timestamped with get_epoch_time_secs() + antientropy_retry - can an attacker manipulate system time to bypass the recent push check and cause duplicate pushes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: refresh_reward_cycles()] [Consensus Divergence] If load_nakamoto_reward_set() fails but returns None instead of an error, can the node continue with stale or missing reward sets, causing invalid block signature validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: check_reload_cached_reward_set()] [Reorg Vulnerability] Can check_reload_cached_reward_set() fail to detect a subtle reorg where the anchor block changes but sortition IDs remain similar, causing the node to use incorrect signing sets for Nakamoto blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: free_old_reward_cycles()] [Off-by-One Error] Does free_old_reward_cycles() use correct boundary check (old_rc).saturating_add(2) < rc, or can it prematurely drop a reward set still needed for validating recent blocks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: refresh_burnchain_view()] [Race Condition] If burnchain_tip changes during refresh_burnchain_view() execution between multiple sortdb queries, can inconsistent state be cached (e.g., chain_view from old tip, stacks_tip from new tip)? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: get_parent_stacks_tip()] [Chain Traversal Error] If get_parent_stacks_tip() encounters a block where NakamotoChainState::get_nakamoto_parent_block_id() returns None due to database corruption, can it return a misleading error instead of clearly indicating database failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: is_reorg()] [False Negative] Can is_reorg() return false when a reorg actually occurred if the ancestor snapshot lookup succeeds but returns a snapshot with matching consensus hash by coincidence (hash collision)? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: is_nakamoto_reorg()] [Infinite Loop] In the for loop iterating from last_stacks_tip_height to stacks_tip_height, if stacks_tip_height is u64::MAX, can integer overflow cause an infinite loop or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: store_transaction()] [Nonce Bypass] Can store_transaction() accept a transaction that passes mempool.submit() validation but violates nonce ordering due to race conditions when multiple transactions for the same account arrive simultaneously? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: store_transactions()] [Consensus Hash Confusion] If NakamotoChainState::get_canonical_block_header() returns None, the function uses FIRST_BURNCHAIN_CONSENSUS_HASH - can this cause transactions to be validated against the wrong chain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: store_transactions()] [Replay Attack] Are network_result.pushed_transactions protected from replay if an attacker captures and retransmits the same (relayers, tx) tuple later with modified relay hints? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: store_transaction()] [Epoch Confusion] If SortitionDB::get_stacks_epoch() returns None due to database inconsistency, does returning false silently drop the transaction without logging, allowing valid transactions to be lost? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: schedule_network_pingbacks()] [Pingback Flooding] Can an attacker create many inbound connections with unique IP addresses, authenticate them, then drop them to fill walk_pingbacks up to MAX_NEIGHBORS_DATA_LEN, preventing legitimate peers from being added? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: schedule_network_pingbacks()] [Sybil Attack] If an attacker controls all authenticated inbound connections and walk_pingbacks reaches MAX_NEIGHBORS_DATA_LEN, does the random drop logic allow the attacker to maintain dominance by repeatedly reconnecting? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: process_neighbor_walk()] [State Corruption] When processing walk_result.broken_connections, if deregister_and_ban_neighbor() is called but the ban fails to persist, can the same broken peer reconnect immediately and corrupt walk state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: find_reciprocal_event()] [Public Key Confusion] Does find_reciprocal_event() verify that both conversations (event_id and reciprocal) are authenticated, or can an unauthenticated connection be paired with an authenticated one, leaking information? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: do_network_work()] [State Machine Deadlock] If need_epoch2_state_machines() returns true but inv_state is None, can the state machine get stuck attempting epoch 2.x work without proper initialization, blocking all network progress? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: do_network_work_epoch2x()] [Infinite Loop] In the while !did_cycle loop, if work_state repeatedly returns to the same state and cur_state never changes, can the loop run indefinitely without the !did_cycle break condition ever triggering? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: dispatch_network()] [Rekey Race Condition] When local_peer.private_key_expire check triggers rekey() at the end of dispatch_network(), can in-flight messages signed with the old key fail validation, causing peer disconnections? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: dispatch_requests()] [Channel Exhaustion] If handles channel fills up and dispatch_request() returns errors, but those errors are only logged without backpressure to the sender, can the sending thread block indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: dispatch_request()] [Message Injection] In NetworkRequest::Broadcast handling, when matching StacksMessageType variants, can an attacker send an unsupported message type that bypasses the match arms and returns InvalidMessage without proper cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/p2p.rs] [Function: dispatch_request()] [Block Advertisement Bypass] Can an attacker bypass disable_block_advertisement check during testing by sending NetworkRequest::AdvertizeBlocks through a different code path that doesn't check the flag? (Low)"
