  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Host Header Handling] Why is the Host header explicitly ignored at lines 294-297 in add_header(), and can this cause security issues if host validation is expected elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: HttpResponseContents::from_stream()] [Hint Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the chunk size hint from generator.hint_chunk_size() at line 84 to cause inefficient chunking or memory allocation patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: HttpResponsePayload::try_from_json()] [Serialization Inconsistency] Can the JSON serialization at line 633 using serde_json::to_value() produce different results than serde_json::to_string() used elsewhere, causing validation bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_serialize()] [Server Header Bypass] Can an attacker add a 'server' header with non-lowercase casing before serialization to bypass the check at line 382 and inject a custom server string? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_serialize()] [Header Ordering Attack] Can the order of header serialization (lines 382-455) be exploited to cause different parsing results on clients that are sensitive to header order? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_serialize()] [Multiple CORS Headers] Can multiple calls to add_CORS_headers() before serialization cause duplicate Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers despite the check at line 396? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: read_to_crlf2()] [EOF Handling] When read_exact() at line 362 returns an EOF error, can partial data in ret cause parsing confusion if the error is not properly propagated? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: read_to_crlf2()] [CRLF at Boundary] If the \\r\\n\\r\\n sequence spans exactly across the HTTP_PREAMBLE_MAX_ENCODED_SIZE boundary, can it be missed by the check at lines 365-369? (High)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: TryFrom<HttpResponsePayload> for HttpResponseContents] [Empty JSON Handling] When converting an Empty payload at line 618, does it correctly produce an empty JSON response or could it cause JSON parsing errors downstream? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [HTTP Version Default] If httparse fails to parse the HTTP version but returns Complete status, can the version field be None at line 481, causing a deserialization error that should have been caught earlier?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: HttpResponsePreamble::from_headers()] [Test-Only Security] Is the from_headers() test function at lines 253-277 accidentally exposed in production builds, allowing attackers to craft arbitrary response preambles? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: remove_header()] [Case Sensitivity Bug] At line 317, remove_header() uses &key instead of &hdr for removal, can this cause the wrong header to be removed or no removal to occur? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: get_header()] [Reserved Header Leak] Can get_header() at lines 322-329 be used to retrieve Content-Length or Content-Type values that were set maliciously before validation? (Low)",
