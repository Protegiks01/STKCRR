  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [pox4 module] [PoxAddress Format Confusion] Does as_clarity_tuple() handle all PoxAddress variants (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR) consistently, or could format differences create signature validation mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Integration] [Contract Mismatch] If the message hash format in make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash() diverges from the get-signer-key-message-hash implementation in the actual PoX-4 Clarity contract, could this cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Integration] [Signature Verification Missing] This file only implements signature creation - where is verification implemented, and could mismatches between signing and verification logic create security holes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Integration] [Public Key Recovery] Does signature verification properly recover and validate the public key from the signature, or could an attacker substitute a different signer's signature? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Integration] [Nonce or Timestamp Missing] The signatures don't include nonces or timestamps - can old signatures be replayed indefinitely across multiple transactions or reward cycles? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Error Handling] [Unwrap Safety] Multiple unwrap() calls throughout the code (lines 31, 65, 69, 73, 112, 119, 124) could panic on malformed input - should these be replaced with proper error handling to prevent node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Error Handling] [Expect Safety] The expect() calls on lines 112 and 124 provide error messages but still panic - are these code paths reachable with adversarial input? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Error Handling] [Result Propagation] Should functions return Result<T, E> instead of panicking to allow graceful error handling at call sites? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cryptography] [Secp256k1 Signature Format] Does MessageSignature use recoverable ECDSA signatures (with recovery ID) or standard signatures, and could this affect signature verification security? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cryptography] [Hash-to-Sign Correctness] Is directly passing msg_hash.as_bytes() to sign() the correct approach, or should there be additional message formatting per ECDSA standards? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cryptography] [Signature Canonicalization] Are signatures canonicalized to prevent malleability where multiple valid signature representations exist for the same (r,s,v) values? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cryptography] [Private Key Type Confusion] The code uses both StacksPrivateKey and Secp256k1PrivateKey - are these compatible, and could type confusion lead to incorrect signature generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [SIP018 Compliance] [Specification Drift] If the SIP018 specification is updated after this implementation, could the fixed STRUCTURED_DATA_PREFIX and message hash construction become incompatible with other SIP018 implementations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [SIP018 Compliance] [Test Vector Validation] The tests reference SIP018 test vectors - if the implementation diverges from these vectors, could it break interoperability with wallets or other SIP018 implementations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [SIP018 Compliance] [Domain Structure] Does the domain tuple structure (name, version, chain-id) match the SIP018 specification exactly, or could field name differences cause validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Testing] [Malicious Input Testing] Do the tests cover adversarial inputs like extremely large values, negative numbers (if signed integers were used), empty strings, or null bytes in string fields? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Testing] [Cross-Chain Testing] Are there tests validating that signatures from one chain_id are properly rejected on another chain_id? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Testing] [Topic Exhaustion] Do tests verify all five Pox4SignatureTopic variants, and could the missing 'agg-increase' handling in the Into trait cause test gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Testing] [Signature Verification] The tests only cover signature generation - are there complementary tests that verify signatures and test rejection of invalid signatures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Performance] [Hashing Cost] Is there a limit on the complexity or size of Clarity values that can be hashed, or could an attacker cause DoS by submitting extremely complex nested structures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Performance] [Signature Generation Cost] Can an attacker flood the system with signature generation requests to exhaust CPU resources, especially for PoX-4 signatures that involve multiple tuple operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Performance] [Memory Allocation] Do repeated calls to serialize_write(&mut bytes) on large Clarity values cause memory fragmentation or allocation spikes? (Low)"
