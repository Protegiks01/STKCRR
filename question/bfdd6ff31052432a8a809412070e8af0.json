  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: decode_tenure_tip()] [Consensus] Does serde_json::from_value() at line 170 properly validate all fields of StacksBlockHeaderTypes including nested structures, or could partially valid but consensus-invalid headers be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: restart()] [State Management] Does setting consensus_hash to None at line 80 fully reset all internal state, or could there be cached data, metrics, or side effects from previous requests that aren't cleared? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: restart()] [Concurrency] If restart() is called while try_handle_request() is executing in another thread, could this cause a race condition where consensus_hash is cleared mid-request? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Struct: RPCNakamotoTenureTipRequestHandler] [Authentication] Does this RPC endpoint require any authentication or rate limiting, or can any network peer query arbitrary tenure tips potentially enabling reconnaissance attacks? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Version Handling] The path uses /v3/ prefix at line 50 - if there are breaking changes in future versions, could clients be confused about which version of tenure tip logic they're querying? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Canonicalization] Are uppercase hex characters (A-F) in the consensus_hash rejected by the regex pattern [0-9a-f], and if so, could this cause issues if different components use different canonicalization rules?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Validation] When querying with a consensus_hash, is there validation that this consensus_hash actually corresponds to a valid tenure (via sortition), or could arbitrary 40-byte hex strings be queried? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Cache Consistency] If the node's chainstate is updated between multiple queries to the same tenure, could clients observe inconsistent tenure tips that violate chain progression invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Edge Case] What happens if find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() is called for a tenure that is currently being processed - could it return a partial or invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Edge Case] If a tenure contains only invalid blocks that failed validation, does the handler return 404 (no blocks) or could it return an invalid block as the 'tip'? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Edge Case] Can StacksBlockHeaderTypes represent epoch 2.x headers, and if so, does returning them from a /v3/ endpoint cause confusion about which consensus rules apply? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Edge Case] For a tenure at a chain reorg boundary, could find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() return a block from the orphaned fork instead of the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: new_get_tenure_tip()] [Edge Case] If ConsensusHash contains null bytes or non-UTF8 sequences, could formatting it into the URL at line 158 cause truncation or encoding issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] What happens if the regex capture group 'consensus_hash' somehow doesn't exist in the captures - does request::get_consensus_hash() handle this gracefully or panic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/gettenuretip.rs] [Function: decode_tenure_tip()] [Edge Case] If the HTTP response contains valid JSON but represents a different structure than expected (e.g., an error response that's also valid JSON), could this bypass error handling? (Medium)",
