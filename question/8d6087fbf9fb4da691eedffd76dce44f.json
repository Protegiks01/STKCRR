  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstxtransfercost.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tuple Pattern Match] The if-let at line 92 destructures get_estimators_ref() into a 3-tuple (_, fee_estimator, metric), discarding the first element - what is being discarded, and could ignoring this component cause the fee estimation to be incomplete or incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstxtransfercost.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Early Return Path] The fee_resp match at lines 135-140 has two paths - one for Ok(fee) and one for Err(response) - but does the error path at line 138 correctly preserve all error information, or could some errors be lost during try_into_contents conversion? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstxtransfercost.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Implicit Unit Conversion] The division at line 126 converts an absolute fee to a fee rate, but are the units clearly defined (microSTX per byte vs STX per byte), and could clients misinterpret the units and apply incorrect multipliers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstxtransfercost.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Median Definition] The code assumes index 1 is the median of 3 estimates (line 115), which is correct for sorted data, but if the estimates are not sorted by the fee estimator, could this return a non-median value that misrepresents the fee market? (Medium)"
