  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 237] [Parser DoS] Can parse_json() be exploited with pathological JSON inputs (e.g., deeply nested arrays, repeated keys, numeric precision edge cases) to cause exponential parsing time? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 71-73] [HTTP Method] Does verb() returning 'GET' enforce that only GET requests are accepted, or can POST, PUT, or other methods with GET-like URLs bypass validation and be processed incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 85-87] [Metrics] Can the metrics_identifier() string be manipulated by attackers to pollute metrics systems, cause cardinality explosions, or inject malicious labels into monitoring infrastructure? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 96-100] [HTTP Compliance] Does the content-length check properly handle HTTP/1.1 Transfer-Encoding: chunked, where Content-Length may be absent but a body is still present? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 113-147] [Analysis Mode] For clarity_metadata_key == 'analysis', what prevents attackers from accessing arbitrary analysis data that might contain sensitive compiler internals, optimization hints, or security-relevant information about contract structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 121-125] [Metadata Type Safety] Can exposing DataMapMeta, VariableMeta, FungibleTokenMeta, or NonFungibleTokenMeta leak information about contract implementation details that could be exploited to bypass access controls or manipulate asset balances? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 126-138] [Contract Metadata] For StoreType::Contract with ContractDataVarName, can attackers enumerate all possible contract metadata variable names (contract, contract-size, contract-src, contract-data-size) to fingerprint contract implementations or extract intellectual property? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 102] [Address Parsing] Can get_contract_address() be exploited with address strings that are valid C32 but decode to invalid addresses, causing downstream operations to misinterpret the contract principal? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 193-196] [Data Encoding] If metadata contains binary data or non-UTF-8 sequences, can get_metadata() returning a String cause encoding corruption, mojibake, or loss of data integrity when round-tripped through JSON? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 204-222] [Error Mapping] Does the handler correctly distinguish between transient errors (network issues, temporary unavailability) and permanent errors (contract doesn't exist, invalid metadata key), or can error misclassification lead to incorrect retries or caching? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 214-221] [Error Recovery] When try_handle_request() returns Err(_), are there cleanup operations that should be performed but aren't, potentially leaving the handler in an inconsistent state for subsequent requests? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 75-83] [Regex Testing] Have all edge cases of the path_regex() been tested, including URLs at MAX_STRING_LEN boundaries, Unicode characters, URL-encoded characters, and combinations of valid/invalid segments? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 117-146] [Validation Testing] Have all possible StoreType enum values been tested against the validation logic, including future enum variants that might be added without updating this handler? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getclaritymetadata.rs] [Lines: 190-201] [Clarity TX Isolation] Does the clarity transaction isolation level guarantee that metadata reads are atomic and consistent, or can partial updates from concurrent transactions be visible? (High)"
