  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/error.rs] [Function: from()] [Error Conversion] Could the conversion from platform::Error to Error via std::io::Error::other() lose critical error context that would aid debugging node shutdown issues, potentially masking underlying signal handling failures? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/error.rs] [Enum: Error] [Resource Management] If MultipleHandlers error is raised but not properly handled by callers, could this lead to resource leaks where signal handlers are registered multiple times without cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/error.rs] [Function: cause()] [Error Chaining] Does the cause() method correctly preserve the error chain for System errors, and could improper handling of None returns for MultipleHandlers errors lead to loss of diagnostic information? (Low)"
