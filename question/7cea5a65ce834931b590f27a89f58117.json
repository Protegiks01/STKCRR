  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] Could a mismatch between the description 'The STX will be locked for the given number of reward cycles (lock-period)' for stack-stx and the actual PoX contract implementation lead developers to misunderstand stacking duration invariants, potentially causing integration bugs in dApps that assume different lock-period semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] Does the description for 'can-stack-stx' at line 62 accurately reflect all preconditions checked by the actual PoX contract function, or could missing preconditions in the documentation lead auditors to overlook validation bypass vectors in the actual contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] The 'stack-aggregation-commit' description states 'This \\",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] Does the BNS 'name-revoke' description accurately state that 'once a name is revoked, no one can change its public key hash or its zone file hash' - if the actual BNS contract allows updates post-revocation, could this enable unauthorized name manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Completeness] The pox_skip_display list at lines 125-130 excludes 'set-burnchain-parameters', 'minimal-can-stack-stx', 'get-reward-set-size', and 'get-reward-set-pox-address' from documentation - if these functions have security-critical preconditions or validation logic, could hiding them from auditors lead to undiscovered vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Completeness] The bns_skip_display list at lines 132-137 hides 'check-name-ops-preconditions' - if this internal function contains the actual validation logic for name operations, could excluding it from documentation prevent security reviewers from verifying that precondition checks are sound? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_json_boot_contracts_reference()] [Version Mismatch] The function hardcodes ClarityVersion::Clarity1 at line 162 when generating documentation - if STACKS_BOOT_CODE_MAINNET includes contracts written for Clarity2 or Clarity3, could this version mismatch cause produce_docs_refs to use incorrect type-checking rules and generate inaccurate function signatures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_json_boot_contracts_reference()] [Error Handling] The serialization at line 164 uses .expect() which will panic if serde_json::to_string fails - while this only affects the docgen CLI tool, could a malformed contract in STACKS_BOOT_CODE_MAINNET cause the documentation generation to crash, preventing proper API reference generation for legitimate contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Function Name Mapping] If a function name in the pox_descriptions HashMap (e.g., 'stack-stx' at line 29) does not exactly match the actual function name in the PoX boot contract, will produce_docs_refs silently skip the description, leading to undocumented functions that auditors might overlook? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] The 'reject-pox' description at line 59 states 'Removed in pox-4' - if this function still exists in earlier PoX versions included in STACKS_BOOT_CODE_MAINNET but the documentation incorrectly implies it's fully removed, could this confuse auditors reviewing multi-version deployments? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] The pox-addr validation description for 'stack-stx' states 'It cannot be a native Segwit address, but it may be a p2wpkh-p2sh or p2wsh-p2sh address' - if the actual PoX contract's address validation logic differs from this description, could invalid addresses be accepted or valid addresses be rejected, violating reward distribution invariants? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/docs.rs] [Function: make_contract_support_docs()] [Documentation Accuracy] The 'delegate-stack-stx' description states 'Once the delegate has stacked > minimum, the delegate should call stack-aggregation-commit' - if this threshold check is not enforced in the actual contract and a delegate can commit below the minimum, could this enable reward set manipulation? (High)"
