  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Command Injection] Can an attacker inject malicious shell commands through the data_path configuration value when it's formatted into the '-datadir=' argument without sanitization, potentially executing arbitrary code on the node host? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Command Injection] Can special characters or command separators (semicolons, pipes, backticks) in the config.burnchain.username field be used to inject additional bitcoind arguments or shell commands through the format! macro? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Command Injection] Can newline characters or null bytes in the config.burnchain.password field break argument parsing and allow injection of malicious bitcoind configuration flags? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Integer Overflow] Can providing u16::MAX or near-maximum values for peer_port or rpc_port cause integer overflow issues when formatted as strings or parsed by bitcoind? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: add_arg()] [Argument Injection] Can an attacker call add_arg() with crafted arguments containing whitespace or special characters to inject multiple bitcoind flags in a single call? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Configuration Override] Can a malicious config provide a peer_port value of 1-65535 to override the -listen=0 flag and force the node to expose network services unintentionally? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Argument Order] Does the order of arguments matter for bitcoind security flags? Can later arguments override critical security settings like -rpcbind=127.0.0.1 if add_arg() is called afterward? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Path Traversal] Can a malicious data_path containing '../' sequences traverse outside the intended directory and cause bitcoind to write blockchain data to arbitrary file system locations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Path Traversal] Does create_dir_all() validate the data_path before creating directories? Can symlink attacks redirect directory creation to sensitive system paths? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Filesystem Race] Is there a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race between create_dir_all() and bitcoind startup that could allow an attacker to swap the directory with a symlink? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Path Validation] Can an empty or root path ('/') be provided as data_path, causing bitcoind to use dangerous default locations or fail to isolate data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Permission Escalation] If data_path points to a directory with elevated permissions, can bitcoind inherit those permissions and enable privilege escalation attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to start_bitcoind() on the same controller instance create multiple bitcoind processes without proper synchronization, leading to port conflicts or data corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [Race Condition] Is there a race between taking bitcoind_process with take() and the actual RPC stop call? Can another thread access the process handle during this window? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: kill_bitcoind()] [Race Condition] Can kill_bitcoind() be called while stop_bitcoind() is executing, causing both to attempt process termination and potentially leaving the controller in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: drop()] [Panic During Drop] If kill_bitcoind() panics due to an error but is called with unwrap() in the Drop implementation, can this cause a double panic and abort the program during stack unwinding? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Process Substitution] Can an attacker replace the 'bitcoind' binary in the PATH with a malicious executable before Command::new() is called? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: is_running()] [State Inconsistency] Does is_running() check if the process is actually alive, or just if the handle exists? Can a zombie process cause incorrect state detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [Process Leak] If wait() is interrupted or the process is in an unkillable state, can this leak process resources or leave bitcoind running in the background? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config()] [Panic on Failure] Does the expect() call on BitcoinRpcClient creation cause a node crash if RPC client initialization fails? Can this be triggered remotely via malformed config? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Credential Exposure] Are RPC credentials (username/password) logged or exposed in process listings when formatted into bitcoind arguments? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [RPC Authentication Bypass] If the rpc_client.stop() call fails authentication, does the error handling allow the process to continue in an inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Missing Authentication] When username and password are both None, does bitcoind start without authentication, allowing unauthorized RPC access from localhost? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Weak Authentication] Does the code enforce minimum password strength or length? Can an empty string be provided as a password? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Denial of Service] Can an attacker cause the read_line() loop to hang indefinitely by manipulating bitcoind's stdout to never output 'Done loading', blocking node startup permanently?
