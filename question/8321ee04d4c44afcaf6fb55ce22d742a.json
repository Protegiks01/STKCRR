  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Block Hash Ordering] If this macro is used for block hashes in fork choice, does the little-endian ordering at lines 417-424 match Bitcoin's block hash comparison semantics? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Transaction ID Derivation] If from_bytes_be is used to parse transaction IDs from network messages, could endianness confusion cause transactions to be rejected or accepted incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [Contract Name Validation] If this macro is used for Clarity contract names, could the regex validation at line 216 reject valid ASCII identifiers or accept Unicode lookalike characters? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_versioned_named_enum!] [Clarity Function Versioning] Could an attacker exploit version boundary checks at line 151-156 to call deprecated functions after a network upgrade, bypassing security fixes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Test: test_macro_define_named_enum_without_docs] [Test Coverage] The test at lines 769-785 only checks basic functionality - are edge cases like empty strings, special characters, or very long names tested? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Test: test_macro_define_named_enum_with_docs] [Documentation Generation] Does the test at lines 787-806 verify that documentation attributes are properly preserved in the generated enum? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Function: is_big_endian()] [Compiler Optimization] Could aggressive compiler optimizations eliminate the u32::from_be call at line 19, causing the function to always return true or false regardless of actual endianness? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Mixed Endianness] If from_bytes and from_bytes_be are both called on the same data, could mixing these APIs in transaction parsing cause some fields to be interpreted with wrong byte order? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Clippy Lint] The #[allow(clippy::non_canonical_clone_impl)] at line 429 suppresses a lint - could this hide real bugs where the clone implementation is incorrect? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Clippy Attribute] The #[allow(clippy::crate_in_macro_def)] at line 204 is unusual - could this indicate the macro is exporting internal crate symbols that should be private? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Pointer Size] The as_ptr() method returns *const $ty - on platforms with different pointer sizes, could this cause issues when arrays are passed between 32-bit and 64-bit contexts? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [String Encoding] Since String is UTF-8 on all platforms, could cross-platform differences in newline handling (\\n vs \\r\\n) affect string validation? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Length Arithmetic] At line 522, _hex_len is assigned but not used - could this indicate missing validation where hex string length should be exactly $len * 2? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Index Arithmetic] In the loop at line 417, the expression $len - 1 - i could underflow if $len is 0 - is there a debug_assert! to catch this? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [Error Construction] The $ErrorVariant at line 214 is called with the original string - could this leak sensitive information in error messages? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Error Return] At line 526, HexError::BadLength is returned with hex_str.len() instead of bytes.len() - could this confuse callers about whether hex or byte length is wrong? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_named_enum!] [Variant Repetition] If the same $VarName literal appears twice, could this cause ambiguous match arms at line 72? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_u8_enum!] [Value Overlap] If two $Val literals have the same value, could the match at line 305-308 incorrectly return the first matching variant instead of detecting duplicates? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_index_newtype!] [Lifetime Bounds] The Index implementations return references with unspecified lifetimes - could this cause borrow checker issues in complex code? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Reference Patterns] The pattern &$thing(ref dat) at line 325 and line 333 uses different mutability - could this pattern matching introduce unexpected aliasing? (Low)",
