  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: empty()] [Inconsistent State] Does empty() creating a peer with last_contact_time=0 but non-zero expire_block violate any invariants that assume contacted peers have been seen recently? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: degree()] [Minimum Value] Is hardcoding the minimum degree to 1 at lines 136-140 correct for all scenarios, or are there cases (e.g., isolated bootstrap nodes) where degree 0 is valid and this logic incorrectly inflates it? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: save_update()] [Mutation Safety] Does save_update() mutating self.last_contact_time at line 55 before the database update create a window where the in-memory state is inconsistent with the database if the update fails at line 56? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: save()] [Mutation Safety] Does save() mutating self.last_contact_time at line 72 before try_insert_peer create inconsistency if the insertion fails and returns false, leaving the Neighbor struct with an updated timestamp that was never persisted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: load_by_address()] [Address Validation] Does load_by_address() validate that neighbor_address.addrbytes and neighbor_address.port are well-formed and not malicious values (e.g., 0.0.0.0:0), or can attackers query for invalid addresses? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: degree()] [Statistical Bias] Does the uniform random sampling at line 135 correctly model the undirected degree probability distribution, or are there edge cases (e.g., in_degree >> out_degree) where the sampling introduces systematic bias? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: empty()] [ASN/Org Validation] Does setting asn=0 and org=0 at lines 40-41 represent 'unknown' or 'unassigned', and can attackers exploit this by creating peers with these values to bypass ASN-based filtering or rate limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: save_update()] [Update Logic] Does save_update() correctly handle the case where a peer's public_key changes between calls, and does PeerDB::update_peer at line 56 properly invalidate old public key associations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: load_by_address()] [Null Handling] If PeerDB::get_peer returns None, does this definitively mean the peer doesn't exist, or could it indicate a database error that should be handled differently at line 95-96? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: All] [Transaction Boundaries] Do save(), save_update(), and load_by_address() assume they are called within an existing database transaction, or do they create their own, and can this lead to transaction nesting issues or deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: degree()] [Concurrency] Is thread_rng() at line 132 thread-safe and does calling it from multiple threads concurrently introduce contention or performance degradation that could be exploited for DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: empty()] [Parameter Cloning] Does cloning NeighborKey and Secp256k1PublicKey at lines 34-35 have performance implications if called repeatedly in a hot path, and can attackers trigger excessive cloning to cause CPU exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: load_by_address()] [Hash Algorithm] Does Hash160::from_node_public_key at line 103 use the same hashing algorithm as was used to generate neighbor_address.public_key_hash, or could algorithm mismatch cause false negatives in the comparison at line 104? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: save()] [Return Value Ambiguity] When save() returns false at line 73, does this indicate frontier full, database error, or other failure modes, and can ambiguity in the return semantics cause incorrect error handling in callers? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/neighbors/neighbor.rs] [Function: degree()] [Range Edge Case] If in_degree equals out_degree, the range becomes min..(min+1) at line 135, making gen_range always return min; is this the intended behavior, or should it return exactly min without randomness? (Low)"
