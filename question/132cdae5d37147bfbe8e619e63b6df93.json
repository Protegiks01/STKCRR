  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Consensus: transaction message validation] Does receiving a Tx message validate signature, nonce, and fee requirements, or could invalid transactions propagate through the network? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Consensus: headers chain validation] Does receiving Headers messages validate the header chain including difficulty adjustments and timestamps, or just deserialize the data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Network: peer reputation] Are malformed messages that fail deserialization tracked per peer for reputation/banning, or could an attacker repeatedly send bad messages without consequence? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Network: rate limiting] Is there rate limiting on message processing based on message type, or could an attacker flood with expensive-to-decode message types? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Network: amplification] Can any message type cause the node to generate significantly more network traffic in response than was received, enabling amplification attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Struct: RawNetworkMessage] [Field Validation] Are the magic and payload fields of RawNetworkMessage validated for consistency (e.g., magic matches payload's expected network), or are they treated independently? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Struct: CommandString] [Length Invariant] Does CommandString maintain the invariant that the inner String is always ≤12 bytes, or could constructor bypasses violate this causing panics later? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Code Quality: panic usage] Is the panic in CommandString::consensus_encode (line 46) appropriate for a network-facing parser, or should it return an error to prevent DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Code Quality: unwrap usage] Is the unwrap() in RawNetworkMessage::consensus_encode (line 162) safe, or should it propagate errors to prevent panic on encoding failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message.rs] [Code Quality: error types] Does UnrecognizedNetworkCommand (line 199) provide sufficient information for debugging, or could more detailed error types improve security monitoring? (Low)"
