  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Struct: NetworkState] [Thread Safety] Is NetworkState thread-safe, or can concurrent access to poll, events, and event_map cause data races? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Event Iteration] Can iterating over self.events at line 388 while modifying event_map and new_events create iterator invalidation or race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Registration Race] Can two threads call register() simultaneously with the same hint_event_id, causing both to select the same event_id? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: make_next_event_id()] [Stateless Race] Since make_next_event_id() is stateless (doesn't modify self), can two callers with the same cur_count get the same event ID? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Field: count] [Atomic Access] Is the count field at line 61 properly synchronized for concurrent access, or can race conditions cause event ID collision? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Connection Flood] Can an attacker rapidly establish and close connections to fill the new_events HashSet without consuming event_map slots, bypassing capacity limits? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: bind_address()] [Retry DoS] Can an attacker hold the bind address to force exponential backoff delays in bind_address(), preventing the node from starting? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Hint Collision DoS] Can an attacker repeatedly provide hint_event_id values that are already taken, forcing expensive next_event_id() searches? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Accept Loop Starvation] Can the accept loop at lines 404-446 starve other event processing if connections arrive faster than they can be accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: make_next_event_id()] [Search Complexity] Can an attacker fill event_map strategically to force O(n) search time in make_next_event_id() for every connection attempt? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Information Leakage] Does the debug! at lines 219-227 log sensitive socket information that could aid attackers in fingerprinting or timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Event ID Disclosure] Does logging next_event_id at line 436 allow attackers to predict future event IDs and preemptively occupy them? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: deregister()] [Debug Information] Do the debug! and warn! messages at lines 245, 248, and 257 expose state that helps attackers optimize connection exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: new()] [Zero Capacity] Can event_capacity be set to 0 at line 66, causing division by zero or breaking all capacity checks throughout the code? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: bind()] [Maximum Servers] Is there a limit on how many servers can be bound, or can servers.len() grow indefinitely and break capacity math? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Empty Events] Can poll() be called with timeout=0, and does this create any timing-sensitive race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Event ID Zero] Can event_id=0 be used for client sockets, and does this conflict with the SERVER constant or server event mappings? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: make_next_event_id()] [Full Capacity] When event_map and in_use together equal event_capacity + servers.len(), does the function correctly return None or can it loop forever? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Token Type Confusion] Can casting between usize and mio::Token types at lines 382, 389, and 458 cause value truncation or type confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Server ID Confusion] Can server_event_id at line 173 be confused with regular event_id values, bypassing the server validation at lines 178-190? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: connect()] [Buffer Size Types] Can u32 buffer size parameters at line 304 cause issues when cast to usize on 32-bit systems? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Struct: NetworkServerState] [State Transitions] Can a NetworkServerState be removed from servers while events for it are still in flight, causing dangling references? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: deregister()] [Double Deregister] Can deregister() be called twice for the same event_id, causing the assertion at line 237 to panic on the second call? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Socket Lifecycle] Can a socket be added to poll_state.new at line 445 but never removed, causing memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: register()] [Pre-registration State] Can register() be called for a socket that's already registered with mio under a different event_id, causing duplicate registrations? (High)"
