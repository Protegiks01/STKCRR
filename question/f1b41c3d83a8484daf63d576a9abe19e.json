  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_pox_4()] [Error Handling] At lines 1297-1301, expect_optional() returns an error instead of panicking - is this inconsistency with pox_1/2/3 intentional, or could it cause different error handling paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_pox_4()] [Type Validation] The RawRewardSetEntry::from_pox_4_tuple at line 1305 could fail - but does it properly validate signer field presence and signing key format? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_pox_4()] [Missing Validation] Unlike pox_1/2/3, this function doesn't check is_pox_active - does pox-4 allow inactive cycles to have reward addresses, creating a protocol difference? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_pox_4()] [Integer Overflow] The num_addrs value at line 1274 is u128 - if this is extremely large, the loop at line 1282 could cause DoS or memory exhaustion. (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_in_cycle()] [Edge Case Handling] The match at lines 1362-1368 catches NoSuchContract error and returns empty vec - but could this mask real errors like DB corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_in_cycle()] [Off-by-One] The reward_cycle_start_height calculation at line 1338 determines which PoX contract is active - could an off-by-one error cause the wrong contract to be queried during cycle transitions? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_reward_addresses_in_cycle()] [Panic Risk] The panic at line 1354 for unknown contract names is a consensus-critical failure point - should this return an error instead? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: get_aggregate_public_key_pox_4()] [Key Length Validation] At line 1397, expect_buff(33) validates the aggregate key length - but what if the contract returns a valid buffer of wrong length?

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: total_signing_weight()] [Integer Overflow] The fold at line 328 uses checked_add but then expects with a FATAL message - could extremely large signer sets cause the sum to exceed u32::MAX and panic? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: total_signing_weight()] [Empty Signer Set] Line 322 returns error if signers is None - but is this condition properly handled by callers, or could it cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: total_signing_weight()] [Arithmetic Overflow] If individual signer weights are near u32::MAX, the accumulation could overflow even with checked_add - is the expect message appropriate for a consensus-critical panic? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/mod.rs] [Function: hex_deserialize()] [Error Handling] The map_err at line 244 converts parsing errors to serde errors - could this lose important error context needed for debugging? (Low)",
