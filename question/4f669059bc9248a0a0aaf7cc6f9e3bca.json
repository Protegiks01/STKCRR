  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Genesis Attachments] [Consensus] If different nodes have different genesis_attachments configured, could this cause immediate consensus divergence at chain start? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Trait: Serialize for GetAttachmentResponse] [Determinism] Does the serde::Serializer implementation guarantee deterministic output across different Rust compiler versions and optimization levels? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Trait: Deserialize for GetAttachmentResponse] [Error Handling] If hex_bytes() or Attachment::new() fail, does the error message leak sensitive information about node state or internal paths? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Derive: Eq, Hash for Attachment] [Collision] Since Attachment derives Eq and Hash based on the content field, could extremely large attachments cause performance degradation in HashSet/HashMap operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Derive: Eq, Hash for AttachmentInstance] [Collision] Could two AttachmentInstances with the same content_hash but different metadata or block heights be treated as equal in hash-based collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: Attachment::empty()] [Semantic Validation] Is an empty attachment (zero bytes) a valid use case? Could empty attachments be used to spam the network or corrupt indices that assume non-empty content? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AttachmentInstance::try_new_from_value()] [Return Value] The function returns Option<AttachmentInstance>. Is None treated as a validation failure that rejects the transaction, or is it silently ignored allowing malformed events to succeed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Module: pub use] [API Exposure] The module exports AtlasDB and AttachmentsDownloader from submodules. Could incorrect visibility modifiers allow external crates to access internal Atlas state without proper validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AtlasConfig::new()] [Contract Whitelist] Only the BNS boot contract is added to the contracts whitelist. Could a hard fork or protocol upgrade require additional contracts, and would old nodes reject new contracts' attachments causing a network split? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AtlasConfig::validate()] [Startup Race] If validate() is called after the node has already started processing attachments, could invalid configuration values cause inconsistent state or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Field: AtlasConfig.contracts] [Mutability] The contracts field is a HashSet without interior mutability controls. Could concurrent modifications to the whitelist cause data races or allow temporarily whitelisting malicious contracts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AttachmentInstance::try_new_from_value()] [Metadata Deserialization] Line 219 sets metadata to String::new() if it's missing. Could downstream code assume metadata is always present and fail when encountering empty strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AttachmentInstance::try_new_from_value()] [Metadata Size] Is there a limit on metadata size before serialization? Could extremely large metadata values (e.g., multi-MB Clarity buffers) cause the serialized hex string to exceed memory limits? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AttachmentInstance::try_new_from_value()] [Metadata Type] The metadata field accepts any Clarity Value. Could passing a Tuple or List with circular references or excessive nesting cause infinite loops during consensus_serialize? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Struct: AttachmentPage] [Inventory Bitmap] If the inventory vector represents a bitmap of 64 attachments, how are bits ordered (LSB vs MSB first)? Could different bit-ordering interpretations cause nodes to disagree on which attachments are present? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Constant: MAX_ATTACHMENT_INV_PAGES_PER_REQUEST] [Boundary Validation] Could requesting page indices that exceed the total number of pages for a block cause index-out-of-bounds errors or return invalid data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Struct: GetAttachmentsInvResponse] [Page Order] If pages are not sorted by index, could this cause inconsistent processing or allow an attacker to reorder pages to confuse inventory tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: Attachment::hash()] [Caching] Is the Hash160 computed every time hash() is called, or is it cached? Could expensive rehashing during validation cause DoS, or could cache poisoning allow hash mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: Attachment::hash()] [Content Mutation] Since Attachment.content is public, could external code mutate it after hash() is called, causing hash/content mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Function: AttachmentInstance::try_new_from_value()] [Hash Comparison] When matching AttachmentInstance.content_hash to Attachment.hash(), are both Hash160 values compared correctly? Could endianness differences cause mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Field: AtlasConfig.uninstantiated_attachments_expire_after] [Time Source] What time source is used for expiration checks? Could clock skew or NTP attacks allow expired attachments to remain active or active attachments to be prematurely deleted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Field: AtlasConfig.unresolved_attachment_instances_expire_after] [Expiration Logic] Are expiration times checked on every block, or periodically? Could an attacker timing attachments to arrive just before expiration checks cause them to persist beyond intended limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Derive: Clone for AtlasConfig] [Deep Copy] Does cloning AtlasConfig deep-copy the HashSet and Option<Vec<Attachment>>? Could shared references cause unexpected mutations across cloned configs? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/atlas/mod.rs] [Derive: PartialEq for AttachmentInstance] [Equality Semantics] Does PartialEq compare all fields including canonical_stacks_tip_height? Could two instances that differ only in canonical tip be treated as duplicates or distinct? (Medium)"
