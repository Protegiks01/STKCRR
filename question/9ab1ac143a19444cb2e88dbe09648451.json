  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Struct: TransactionResponse] [Data Validation] The tx field is a String (hex) rather than a typed Transaction - could invalid hex strings be stored in responses, breaking client parsing assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Struct: TransactionResponse] [Data Validation] The result field is a String without type constraints - could it contain arbitrarily large data (e.g., verbose error traces) causing memory issues in clients? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Struct: TransactionResponse] [Invariant Violation] The block_height is Option<u64> while is_canonical is bool - if block_height is None, should is_canonical always be false, and is this invariant enforced anywhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Struct: TransactionResponse] [Serialization] The StacksBlockId is serialized directly - does its Serialize impl produce deterministic output, or could different nodes produce different JSON for the same block hash? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Struct: RPCGetTransactionRequestHandler] [State Management] The txid field is Option<Txid> and gets set to None in new() and restart() - is there any code path where try_handle_request() is called without a prior successful try_parse_request()? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Function: restart()] [Cleanup] The restart() function only resets txid to None - are there any other fields or resources that should be cleaned up but aren't? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] The new() function initializes txid to None - is there any validation that the handler is in a valid state before use, or could an uninitialized handler cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Rate Limiting] Is there any rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent an attacker from flooding it with queries and causing database exhaustion or MARF index thrashing? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Authentication] Does this endpoint require any authentication or authorization, or can any network peer query arbitrary transaction data, potentially aiding in deanonymization attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Timing Attacks] Do the different code paths (txindex disabled, tx not found, tx found) have distinguishable response times that could allow an attacker to enumerate transactions or infer system state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [TOCTOU] Between checking node.txindex at line 99 and querying the database at line 121, could the index be modified or deleted, causing inconsistent state or crashes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Memory Safety] Are there any unsafe blocks or FFI calls in the called functions (get_tx_info_from_txid, get_ancestor_block_height) that could cause memory corruption if given unexpected inputs from this endpoint? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Integer Overflow] The block_height is u64 - could extremely large block heights cause overflow in arithmetic operations in client code that consumes this API? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Regex DoS] The regex at line 57 is relatively simple, but could catastrophic backtracking occur with carefully crafted inputs that almost match but fail? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [API Versioning] The endpoint is /v3/transaction/:txid - are there v1 or v2 equivalents, and if so, do they return consistent data, or could version differences cause consensus issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Data Consistency] If a transaction is returned with is_canonical=true but a subsequent query shows is_canonical=false, does this indicate a reorg, and are clients expected to handle this correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Microblock Handling] Does this endpoint handle transactions in microblocks correctly, or could microblock-specific edge cases cause incorrect canonical status determination? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Nakamoto Blocks] Given the NakamotoChainState import at line 22, does this endpoint properly handle Nakamoto-specific transaction types and tenure transitions, or could pre-Nakamoto assumptions cause bugs? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [State Pruning] If the node prunes old state or transaction indices, could queries for old transactions fail unexpectedly, and is this failure mode distinguishable from 'transaction never existed'? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettransaction.rs] [General] [Byzantine Responses] If this endpoint is called on a Byzantine node, could it return falsified transaction data with valid structure, and would clients be able to detect the forgery? (Critical)"
