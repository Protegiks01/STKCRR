  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Boundary] If consensus_hash corresponds to a tenure boundary where leadership changes, does find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() correctly identify which tenure the block belongs to, or could boundary blocks be miscategorized? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Microblock Handling] Are microblocks considered when determining the 'highest' block in a tenure, or does this only consider anchored blocks, and could omitting microblocks provide an inconsistent view of chain state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Sortition Validation] Is the sortdb parameter used to validate that the consensus_hash corresponds to a winning Bitcoin block sortition, or could an attacker query metadata for non-winning sortitions? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Request Validation] Does the handler validate the HTTP method is exactly GET (case-sensitive), or could variations like 'get', 'Get', or 'GET\\x00' bypass the verb check at line 49? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Path Traversal] Could URL-encoded characters (%2F for /, %2E for .) in the consensus_hash parameter bypass the regex validation and cause path traversal or unexpected routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Null Pointer] If node.with_node_state() is called with null or uninitialized sortdb or chainstate parameters, could this cause null pointer dereferences or panics in find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure()? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Struct: BlockHeaderWithMetadata] [Memory Safety] Are the anchored_header and burn_view fields properly owned by BlockHeaderWithMetadata, or could they reference memory that is freed before serialization, causing use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Integer Overflow] If the tenure contains an extremely large number of blocks, could calculations within find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() overflow when determining the 'highest' block? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] The new() constructor at lines 40-44 initializes consensus_hash to None. Is this the correct initial state, or should it be Some(default_value) to prevent errors if try_parse_request() is not called? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Information Leakage] The metrics identifier at line 58 uses a placeholder ':consensus_hash'. Could metrics collected under this identifier aggregate statistics across different consensus hashes, leaking pattern information? (Low)"
