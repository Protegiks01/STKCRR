  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Handling] If try_from_json fails, does the error properly propagate to the client with appropriate context, or is the error generic and unhelpful for debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Deserialization] Can a malicious server return a JSON response that deserializes into an invalid Vec<NeighborAddress> (e.g., with corrupted addrbytes or public_key_hash), causing the client to accept invalid peer data? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [DoS] Can a malicious server return a JSON array larger than MAX_LIST_REPLICAS, causing the client to allocate excessive memory during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Type Confusion] Does parse_json validate that the response is actually an array before attempting to deserialize into Vec<NeighborAddress>, or can type confusion occur with object vs array? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Error Handling] If the body contains valid JSON but with unexpected field names or types in NeighborAddress, does the deserialization fail gracefully or panic? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: decode_stackerdb_replicas()] [Error Information Leakage] Does the generic error message 'Failed to load from JSON' provide enough context for debugging, or should it include more details about what specifically failed? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: decode_stackerdb_replicas()] [Validation] After deserializing into Vec<NeighborAddress>, are the addresses validated (e.g., checking that they're not anynet or conform to expected formats), or are they trusted blindly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: decode_stackerdb_replicas()] [Type Safety] Can get_http_payload_ok() return a payload that's not actually 'ok' status due to a bug in status code handling, causing decode_stackerdb_replicas to process error responses as valid data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: decode_stackerdb_replicas()] [Deserialization DoS] If the JSON contains deeply nested structures or excessive array elements, can serde_json::from_value consume excessive CPU/memory during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: new_list_stackerdb_replicas()] [Format String] Does the format! call properly escape special characters in stackerdb_contract_id.issuer and stackerdb_contract_id.name, or can path traversal or injection occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: new_list_stackerdb_replicas()] [Error Handling] The expect() message says 'FATAL: failed to construct request from infallible data' - is this truly infallible, or can malformed QualifiedContractIdentifier values cause panics? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: new_list_stackerdb_replicas()] [URL Encoding] Are the contract issuer and name properly URL-encoded in the path, or can special characters (e.g., /, %, ?) break URL parsing or routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: restart()] [State Management] Does restart() fully reset all state, or can residual data from contract_identifier or other fields persist across requests if restart() is not called? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Regex Validation] Can the regex pattern be exploited with crafted paths that cause catastrophic backtracking, given the STANDARD_PRINCIPAL_REGEX_STRING and CONTRACT_NAME_REGEX_STRING complexity? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Struct: RPCListStackerDBReplicasRequestHandler] [Thread Safety] If this handler is used in a multi-threaded context, can concurrent access to self.contract_identifier cause race conditions or data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Access Control] Is there any authentication or rate limiting applied to this endpoint, or can anyone query for replica lists indefinitely, potentially enabling reconnaissance attacks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Information Disclosure] By repeatedly querying different contract identifiers and observing response times, can an attacker infer which contracts are popular or have many replicas, leaking network topology? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Cryptographic Validation] Are the public_key_hash values in NeighborAddress validated against the actual public keys of the peers, or can peers lie about their identity? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Time-based Logic] Does the use of get_epoch_time_secs() for filtering peers by last_contact_time create opportunities for clock skew attacks or time-based DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Propagation] When PeerDB::find_stacker_db_replicas returns an error, is the error logged with sufficient detail (contract_id, error type) to diagnose database issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Memory Safety] When converting neighbors to NeighborAddress via from_neighbor(), can any unsafe memory operations or buffer overflows occur in the underlying implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Ordering Consistency] Does the order of replicas in the response matter for client behavior, and if so, can an attacker manipulate database state to control ordering and influence client peer selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Constant: MAX_LIST_REPLICAS] [Protocol Consistency] If different nodes use different MAX_LIST_REPLICAS values (e.g., due to version skew), can this cause inconsistent view of the network and affect StackerDB synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: verb()] [HTTP Method Validation] Is the 'GET' verb properly enforced at a lower layer, or can an attacker send POST/PUT/DELETE requests that bypass the verb() check? (Low)",
