  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [UnexpectedChainState Error] If get_block_processed_and_signed_weight() returns None, UnexpectedChainState is returned - but can this occur during normal reorgs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Miner Status Blocked Check] get_miner_status().is_blocked() is checked to determine if mining can continue - but can this status be stale or inconsistent with actual block processing? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Mutex Poisoning] expect('FATAL: mutex poisoned') is used for miner_status lock - but can panics in other threads poison this mutex, causing miner shutdown? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Abort Flag Check] abort_flag.load(Ordering::SeqCst) is checked during waiting - but is SeqCst the correct ordering, or could weaker orderings suffice? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Sortition DB Open Loop] SortitionDB::open() is called in every iteration - but can repeated opens cause file descriptor exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: pause_and_retry()] [Rejection Pause Configuration] first_rejection_pause_ms and subsequent_rejection_pause_ms are configurable - but can setting these to 0 cause the miner to spam signers with repeated proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: pause_and_retry()] [Last Block Rejected State] last_block_rejected is set to true after pause - but is this state properly reset when switching tenures or when a block is accepted? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: pause_and_retry()] [Error Logging] The error is logged with block metadata - but can verbose error logging leak sensitive mining information? (Low)"
