  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_rows()] [SQL Injection] Although parameterized queries are used, if sql_query is constructed by concatenating user input elsewhere, could injection still occur through column names or table names? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_rows()] [Memory Exhaustion] If a malicious query returns millions of rows, will collect() cause OOM, or are there row limits enforced elsewhere in the codebase? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_rows()] [Error Propagation] If FromRow::from_row() fails midway through processing results, does the error correctly rollback any partial state changes, or could it leave the database in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_rows()] [Iterator Semantics] The collect() operation consumes the entire result set; could this lead to holding database locks longer than necessary, causing transaction deadlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row()] [Excess Rows Ignored] If a query unexpectedly returns multiple rows when only one was expected, silently ignoring excess rows could mask database corruption or query logic errors. Should this panic instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row()] [QueryReturnedNoRows] Is the conversion of QueryReturnedNoRows to Ok(None) always semantically correct? Could some callers misinterpret 'not found' vs 'query failed'? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row()] [Transaction Isolation] If query_row is called within a transaction and another transaction has uncommitted changes to the queried row, could the result be non-deterministic? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_expect_row()] [Panic Condition] The assert! on line 441-445 will panic if multiple rows are returned. Could an attacker craft database state or queries to trigger this panic, causing a DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_expect_row()] [Consensus Critical Panics] If this function is used in block validation logic, could a malicious miner craft a block that causes this panic in validators but not in their own node? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_expect_row()] [Error Message Leakage] Does the panic message on line 443-444 leak sensitive information about database schema or query structure that could aid attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row_panic()] [Custom Panic] The panic_message closure allows arbitrary panic messages. Could this be abused to inject misleading error messages that hide the real issue? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row_panic()] [Panic vs Error] Why does this function panic instead of returning an error? Could this make recovery from certain database states impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row_columns()] [Column Name Validation] If column_name is constructed from user input, could an attacker query arbitrary columns including sensitive data? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row_columns()] [Type Confusion] If the column type doesn't match T: FromColumn<T>, will the error be clear, or could silent type coercion lead to incorrect values? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_row_columns()] [Empty Result Set] Is returning an empty Vec always correct, or should some callers distinguish between 'no matches' and 'column not found'? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_one_row_column()] [Panic Message] The panic on line 519 with panic_msg could be triggered by database corruption. Should this gracefully degrade instead of crashing the node? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_one_row_column()] [MARF Queries] If this function queries MARF-indexed data and gets multiple results due to MARF corruption, will the panic prevent further damage, or just make recovery harder? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_int()] [Overflow Error Reuse] Line 539 returns Error::Overflow when multiple rows are found, but this error type is meant for numeric overflow. Could this mislead error handling code? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_int()] [NotFoundError] If a count query legitimately returns 0, will this be distinguishable from a missing table/column error? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_int()] [i64 vs u64] Since many counts should be unsigned, could returning i64 lead to negative count bugs elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_count()] [Wrapper Function] Since this just calls query_int, are there any semantic differences in how counts vs generic integers should be handled? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [query_count()] [COUNT(*) Overflow] If a table has more than i64::MAX rows (theoretically possible with corruption), will query_count overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [log_sql_eqp()] [Debug Information Leakage] In test mode with BLOCKSTACK_DB_TRACE=1, the query logging could expose sensitive data or database structure to logs. Is this acceptable? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [log_sql_eqp()] [Mock Arguments] Line 380 replaces all ? placeholders with 'mock_arg', which could produce invalid SQL. Could this lead to misleading debugging information? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [log_sql_eqp()] [Production Usage] Is the #[cfg(not(test))] on line 391-392 sufficient to ensure this is never called in production? Could test code accidentally be compiled into release builds? (Low)"
