  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Empty Tenure Stream] If RPCTenureStream created at line 132 yields zero blocks, can the JSON streaming complete properly or does it create malformed JSON with trailing commas or incomplete arrays? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Transitions] Can requesting a burnchain_block_height exactly at a tenure transition boundary cause find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure_by_block_height() at line 99 to return ambiguous results from multiple tenures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Nakamoto vs Epoch2] Does the endpoint properly handle burnchain_block_height values from pre-Nakamoto epochs, or can it incorrectly attempt to query Nakamoto-specific data structures for Epoch 2.x heights? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Microblock Handling] Can the tenure returned at line 125 correctly represent tenures with both anchor blocks and microblocks, or does the empty stacks_blocks at line 129 omit microblock data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Metric Cardinality] Can the metrics identifier at line 53 that uses a template path cause metric cardinality explosion if actual burnchain_block_height values are substituted, overwhelming monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Overall Structure] [Inconsistent Implementations] Does this endpoint handle error cases, stream creation, and tenure data differently than similar endpoints (e.g., gettenureblocks.rs), potentially causing inconsistent behavior across the API surface? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Stream Backpressure] Can the HttpResponseContents::from_stream() at line 155 properly handle backpressure if the client is slow to consume tenure block data, or can it buffer unbounded amounts of data in memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Stream Error Handling] If RPCTenureStream encounters an error mid-stream after initial response headers are sent at line 154, can the error be properly communicated to the client or will the connection be silently closed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Node State Lock] Can the with_node_state closure at line 97 deadlock if chainstate or sortdb are locked by other operations, preventing the API endpoint from responding? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Mempool Parameter Unused] The _mempool parameter at line 97 is unused - can this cause issues if mempool state needs to be consulted for pending blocks or transactions related to the tenure? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [RPC Args Unused] The _rpc_args parameter at line 97 is unused - can this prevent applying necessary RPC-level configurations like timeouts, limits, or authentication checks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureblocksbyheight.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Network Parameter Unused] The _network parameter at line 97 is unused - can this cause issues determining which network (mainnet/testnet) the burnchain_block_height refers to? (Medium)"
