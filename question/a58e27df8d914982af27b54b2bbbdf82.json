  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [Error enum] [Consensus Divergence] Can the Error::Corruption variant be triggered by legitimate database state transitions, potentially causing nodes to reject valid blocks and diverge from consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [Error enum] [State Corruption] Does the Error::InvalidPoxSortition error allow attackers to mask actual PoX sortition validation failures by returning this error for unrelated database issues? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl From<serde_error>] [Error Masking] Could serialization errors in consensus-critical data be silently converted to generic Error::SerializationError, hiding the root cause and leading to inconsistent error handling across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl From<MARFError>] [MARF Integrity] Can MARF corruption errors be improperly classified through this conversion, allowing nodes to continue with an inconsistent MARF state instead of halting? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [Error::OldSchema] [Upgrade Safety] Could the OldSchema error variant be exploited during network upgrades to force nodes into incompatible states by reporting incorrect schema versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [Error::TooOldForEpoch] [Fork Creation] Can the TooOldForEpoch error be triggered inconsistently across nodes during epoch boundaries, causing some nodes to accept blocks that others reject? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [Error::BlockHeightOutOfRange] [Integer Overflow] Does this error properly catch all block height overflow scenarios, or can edge cases around u32::MAX and u64::MAX lead to silent wraparound? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromRow<u64>] [Integer Conversion] In the i64-to-u64 conversion, if a database returns i64::MAX, will the cast to u64 preserve the correct value, or could this lead to off-by-one errors in block heights or reward calculations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromRow<u64>] [Negative Value Handling] If malicious data or database corruption causes a negative i64 to be stored where u64 is expected, does the ParseError properly prevent consensus divergence, or could some code paths bypass this check? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromRow<StacksAddress>] [Address Validation] Can the StacksAddress::from_string() parsing accept malformed addresses that should be rejected, potentially allowing transactions to invalid addresses to be stored in the database? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromRow<StacksAddress>] [C32 Encoding] If the database contains a string that passes from_string() but represents an address with an invalid version byte or checksum, will downstream code detect this, or could it lead to fund loss? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<u64>] [Column Name Ambiguity] If multiple columns in a row have similar names, could column_name matching retrieve the wrong value, leading to incorrect block heights or PoX cycle numbers being used? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<Option<u64>>] [NULL Handling] In the Option<u64> conversion, if a NULL database value represents 'infinity' or 'max height' in some contexts, could this be misinterpreted as 'no value' leading to incorrect fork choice? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<QualifiedContractIdentifier>] [Contract ID Parsing] Can the QualifiedContractIdentifier::parse() function accept contract IDs with invalid characters or lengths that could later cause Clarity VM execution to diverge? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<QualifiedContractIdentifier>] [Principal Validation] If parse() succeeds but the principal component is malformed, could this lead to contract-call transactions being processed incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<Secp256k1PublicKey>] [Key Validation] Does from_hex() validate that the public key lies on the secp256k1 curve, or could an invalid but correctly-formatted hex string be stored and later cause signature verification to fail unexpectedly? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<Secp256k1PublicKey>] [Compressed Key Handling] If the database stores both compressed and uncompressed public key formats, does from_hex() handle both consistently, or could this lead to signature verification mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<Secp256k1PrivateKey>] [Private Key Security] Should private keys ever be stored in and loaded from SQLite databases? Could this exposure lead to key theft if database files are improperly secured? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl FromColumn<Secp256k1PrivateKey>] [Key Range Validation] Does from_hex() validate that the private key is within the valid secp256k1 scalar range [1, n-1], or could invalid keys lead to signature generation failures? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [u64_to_sql()] [Overflow Detection] The function checks if x > i64::MAX and returns ParseError, but is this check applied consistently before all database writes? Could missing checks allow u64 values > i64::MAX to be written incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [u64_to_sql()] [Consensus Divergence] If block heights or reward cycle numbers exceed i64::MAX (unlikely but possible in far future), will all nodes consistently reject them, or could some nodes accept them leading to divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [opt_u64_to_sql()] [None vs Zero] In contexts where None and Some(0) have different semantic meanings, could incorrect use of this function lead to confusion between 'no value' and 'zero value'? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [opt_u64_to_sql()] [Transaction Nonce] If this function is used for transaction nonces, could a None value be misinterpreted as nonce 0, allowing nonce replay or skipping? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl_byte_array_from_column!] [Hex Decoding] In the macro expansion, does hex_bytes() validate hex string length matches the expected byte array size, or could truncated/padded values lead to hash mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/db.rs] [impl_byte_array_from_column!] [FromSql Implementation] If ValueRef contains non-string data (blob instead of text), will the as_str() call fail gracefully, or could it cause panics or data corruption? (High)"
