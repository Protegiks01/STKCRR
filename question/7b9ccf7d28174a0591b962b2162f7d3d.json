  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxInput] [Serialization Ambiguity] Can a single input be serialized as both Structured and Raw with different byte representations, enabling transaction malleability? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxInput] [Migration Bug] When upgrading from 2.05 to 2.1+, can inputs that were successfully parsed as Structured fail to parse as Raw, causing previously valid blocks to become invalid? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [txid Collision] Does the txid field at line 218 guarantee uniqueness, or can two different transactions have the same txid due to malleability or hash collisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [vtxindex Validation] Can the vtxindex field at line 219 exceed the actual number of transactions in a block, causing out-of-bounds access or incorrect indexing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [opcode Validation] Does the opcode field at line 220 validate against the set of recognized Stacks burnchain operation codes (block commit, user burn, etc.), or can invalid opcodes be processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [data Field Size] Can the data Vec<u8> at line 221 exceed maximum sizes, enabling DoS attacks or causing memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [data_amt Overflow] Can the data_amt field (u64) at line 223 overflow when summed with other amounts, or be set to u64::MAX to manipulate fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Empty Inputs] Can the inputs vector at line 224 be empty, representing a coinbase transaction that should be handled specially or rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Empty Outputs] Can the outputs vector at line 225 be empty, and if so, does this represent a valid burn or should it be rejected as invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Input/Output Sum Mismatch] Does BitcoinTransaction validate that the sum of input values equals or exceeds the sum of output values plus fees, or can transactions create BTC out of thin air? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Duplicate Inputs] Can the inputs vector contain duplicate tx_ref entries (same Txid and output index), enabling double-spend attempts? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Serialization Size] Does the Serialize derive at line 216 enforce maximum transaction size limits consistent with Bitcoin consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Block Height Validation] Can the block_height field at line 230 be manipulated to be non-contiguous with the parent block, causing chain reorganization vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Hash Collision] Does the block_hash field at line 231 guarantee collision resistance, or can an attacker craft two blocks with the same hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Parent Hash Validation] Does BitcoinBlock validate that parent_block_hash at line 232 matches an existing block in the chain, preventing orphan blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Empty Block] Can the txs vector at line 233 be empty, and if so, does this represent a valid Bitcoin block without a coinbase transaction? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Timestamp Validation] Can the timestamp field at line 234 be set to arbitrary values (future time, past time, or zero), enabling timestamp manipulation attacks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Timestamp Overflow] Can the timestamp (u64) overflow when performing arithmetic operations for median-time-past or time-based consensus rules? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock::new()] [Constructor Validation] Does the new() constructor at lines 238-252 perform any validation on the input parameters, or does it blindly accept invalid values? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock::new()] [Clone Performance] Does the constructor clone BurnchainHeaderHash values at lines 247-248, and can this lead to performance issues or DoS when processing many blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Block Size Limit] Does BitcoinBlock enforce Bitcoin's maximum block size or weight limits, or can oversized blocks be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Transaction Ordering] Does BitcoinBlock preserve the canonical ordering of transactions as they appear in the Bitcoin block, or can reordering cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
