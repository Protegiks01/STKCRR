  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: is_running()] [Stale State] After stop_bitcoind() or kill_bitcoind() completes successfully, does is_running() immediately return false, or is there a window where it reports stale state? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Struct: BitcoinCoreController] [Clone Safety] Is BitcoinCoreController Clone or Copy? Can multiple owners lead to double-free of the Child process handle? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Struct: BitcoinCoreController] [Send/Sync Safety] Is BitcoinCoreController Send and Sync? Can it be safely shared across threads without synchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Information Disclosure] Does the info! log at line 124 expose sensitive command-line arguments like RPC credentials in debug logs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [Information Disclosure] Does logging the RPC response message expose internal bitcoind state or configuration details? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Information Disclosure] Does the info! log when peer port is disabled reveal information about the node's network configuration to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: add_arg()] [Invalid Arguments] Can add_arg() accept empty strings or whitespace-only arguments that could confuse bitcoind's argument parser? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Unicode Handling] Can non-ASCII or Unicode characters in username, password, or data_path cause parsing errors or encoding issues in bitcoind? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Null Byte Injection] Can null bytes in configuration strings truncate arguments prematurely when passed to the bitcoind process? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Network Mode] Does the hardcoded '-regtest' flag mean this controller only works with regtest? Can it handle mainnet or testnet bitcoind instances? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Rest Interface] Does enabling '-rest' expose an unauthenticated HTTP REST API? What security risks does this introduce? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Onion Routing] Does '-listenonion=0' prevent Tor connections? Can this be overridden to expose the node's real IP address? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: from_stx_config_and_client()] [Listen Mode] When peer_port equals 0, does '-listen=0' completely disable P2P networking? Can this isolate the node from critical Bitcoin consensus updates? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Mutable Reference] Does start_bitcoind() require &mut self for thread safety? Can multiple threads call this simultaneously on different controllers safely? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [Synchronization] Is there interior mutability in the rpc_client that could cause data races when stop() is called concurrently from multiple threads? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Struct: BitcoinCoreController] [Arc Safety] If BitcoinCoreController is wrapped in Arc, can methods be safely called from multiple threads, or is external synchronization required? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Empty Output] What happens if bitcoind produces no stdout output at all? Does the bytes_read == 0 check trigger immediately or after a timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: start_bitcoind()] [Partial Line] Can read_line() be called when only a partial line is available in the buffer, causing it to block indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: stop_bitcoind()] [Already Stopped] If bitcoind has already exited naturally, does calling stop_bitcoind() handle this gracefully or return an error? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/bitcoin/core_controller.rs] [Function: kill_bitcoind()] [Already Killed] If bitcoind is already dead, does kill() return an error? Is this error properly handled? (Low)",
