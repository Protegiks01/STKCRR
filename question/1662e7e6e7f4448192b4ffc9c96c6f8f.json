  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [Microblock Confirmation Status] Does the function ensure that 'confirmed' microblocks are only those whose child block is confirmed, or could the definition of 'confirmed' be ambiguous leading to serving unconfirmed data? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Regex Anchoring] The regex pattern at line 68 uses '^' and '$' anchors, but are these sufficient to prevent path traversal if the HTTP server normalizes paths differently than the regex engine? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Genesis Block Edge Case] If child_block_id refers to the genesis block or boot block, does get_confirmed_microblock_index_hash() correctly handle this special case where no parent microblocks exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [Empty Microblock Stream] If the parent block produced no microblocks, does the function return an empty stream or an error, and is this behavior correctly interpreted by clients? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Network Interruption] If the client closes the connection while streaming at line 152, does the stream properly detect this and stop processing, or could it continue reading from the database unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Response Format Validation] Does the client properly validate that the response bytes represent a valid sequence of microblocks with correct length prefixes, or could a malicious server send corrupted data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_getmicroblocks_confirmed()] [PeerHost Validation] Does the function validate the PeerHost parameter at line 173 to prevent connections to malicious or internal endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Rate Limiting] Is there any rate limiting on requests to this endpoint to prevent an attacker from repeatedly querying expensive block_ids and causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Authentication] Does this endpoint require authentication or authorization, or can any network peer request confirmed microblocks, potentially exposing sensitive chain state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Query String Handling] The query parameter is stored at line 93 but never used in try_handle_request()—could this lead to unexpected behavior if clients pass query parameters expecting them to be processed? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Caching] Should responses from this endpoint be cacheable since confirmed microblocks are immutable, and does the lack of cache headers cause unnecessary repeated chainstate queries? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [Error Code Consistency] Does the function use consistent error types (ChainError::NoSuchBlockError) across all failure paths, or could different error types cause confusion in error handling logic? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Node State Validity] Does with_node_state() validate that the node is fully synced and not in a startup or shutdown state before accessing chainstate, or could this serve stale/incomplete data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [StacksBlockId Type Safety] Does the StacksBlockId type used at line 48 enforce cryptographic properties (e.g., correct hash length, valid format) or is it just a type alias that could contain invalid data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [URL Encoding] Does the block_id extraction at line 90 properly handle URL encoding/decoding, or could percent-encoded characters in the path bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Memory Consumption] When boxing the stream at line 152, is there monitoring of memory usage if the microblock tail is very long, potentially causing OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [Reorg Safety] If a chain reorganization occurs between client request and response streaming, could the client receive microblocks that are no longer on the canonical chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Deserialization Security] Does parse_bytes() at line 166 use a safe deserialization method that prevents arbitrary code execution or memory corruption from malformed microblock data? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Timeout Handling] Is there a timeout mechanism for stream creation and reading to prevent clients from holding connections open indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: new_confirmed()] [Block Height Validation] Does the function validate that child_block_id is at a valid block height and not from a future height that hasn't been mined yet? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getmicroblocks_confirmed.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Partial Stream Handling] If StacksIndexedMicroblockStream encounters an error mid-stream, does it properly signal this to the client via HTTP chunked encoding, or could clients receive truncated data? (Medium)"
