  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Constant: MAX_HINT_REPLICAS] [Constant Value] Line 62 defines MAX_HINT_REPLICAS as 128 - what happens if a contract's hint-replicas list is exactly 128 entries and some are filtered for being private IPs? Could this cause issues if the remaining count is below some minimum? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Cross-Function: parse_slot_entry + eval_signer_slots] [Validation Duplication] Both functions check num_slots > STACKERDB_INV_MAX (lines 192-194 and 244-254) - if the constants or logic diverge in future updates, could this cause inconsistent validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Cross-Function: eval_config + eval_hint_replicas] [Error Handling Inconsistency] eval_config() has FATALs at lines 406, 424, 441, 458, 489 while eval_hint_replicas() has FATALs at lines 291, 296, 301 - are these reachable if the type system is bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Cross-Function: Type System] [Admits Type Evolution] The admits_type() checks at lines 146-152 and 155-160 are epoch-dependent - could a contract validated in one epoch become invalid in another, causing existing StackerDBs to break after an epoch transition? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Cross-Function: Error Propagation] [NetError Wrapping] Multiple functions wrap errors in NetError::InvalidStackerDBContract (e.g., lines 227-230, 250-253) - could error details be lost in this wrapping, making debugging difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_signer_slots()] [Zero Slots] At lines 235-276, if a signer has num_slots = 0, it passes all validation checks - could an attacker register multiple signers with 0 slots to bloat the signers vector without contributing to total_num_slots? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_hint_replicas()] [Public Key Hash Validation] At lines 346-353, the public-key-hash is extracted as 20 bytes but never validated for correctness - could an attacker use all-zeros, all-ones, or other invalid hash values? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Contract ID Validation] The contract_id parameter is used throughout but never validated for correctness (e.g., could it be malformed, use reserved names, or refer to a non-existent principal)? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Local Override Security] At lines 474-482, local_max_neighbors can override the contract value downward but not upward - could this create a centralization vector where node operators must coordinate on the same local_max_neighbors value?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_hint_replicas()] [Port 1024 Boundary] At line 333, ports below 1024 are rejected, but on many systems, binding to these ports requires root privileges - is this validation intended to prevent privilege escalation or configuration errors? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: parse_slot_entry()] [Standard Principal Conversion] At line 201, StacksAddress::from(standard_principal.clone()) is used - could different versions of the codebase convert the same standard_principal to different StacksAddress values, causing consensus divergence?
