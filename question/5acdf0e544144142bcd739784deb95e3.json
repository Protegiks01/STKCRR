  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/prometheus.rs] [Histogram: MEMPOOL_TX_CONFIRM_TIME] [Memory Growth] Could the histogram at lines 226-231 accumulate observations indefinitely without periodic resets, causing memory growth proportional to transaction volume over the node's lifetime? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/prometheus.rs] [IntCounterVec: MSG_COUNTER_VEC] [Memory Growth] Could MSG_COUNTER_VEC at lines 203-207 create new label combinations for each unique message type, causing linear memory growth with message type diversity? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/prometheus.rs] [Gauges: LAST_BLOCK_READ_COUNT through LAST_BLOCK_RUNTIME] [Execution Cost Accuracy] Could the execution cost gauges at lines 97-120 be updated with intermediate values during block processing, causing transient incorrect values that trigger false alerts in monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/prometheus.rs] [Gauges: LAST_MINED_BLOCK_READ_COUNT through LAST_MINED_BLOCK_RUNTIME] [Cost Validation] Could the mined block execution cost gauges at lines 127-150 differ significantly from processed block costs, indicating miners are bypassing cost accounting validation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/prometheus.rs] [Gauge: LAST_BLOCK_WRITE_LENGTH] [Overflow Risk] Could extremely large write_length values overflow LAST_BLOCK_WRITE_LENGTH at lines 112-115 if stored as f64, losing precision and causing monitoring systems to miss blocks that exceed execution cost limits? (Medium)"
