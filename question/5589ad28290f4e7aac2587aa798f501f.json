  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Memory Safety] The as_ptr() and as_mut_ptr() methods at lines 324-335 return raw pointers - if these are used with FFI or unsafe code, could improper lifetime management cause use-after-free bugs? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Const Correctness] The len() method at line 340 returns $len directly - if $len is not a compile-time constant, could this cause runtime overhead in hot loops? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Redundant Check] The is_empty() method at line 347 always returns false - could code relying on this method for validation incorrectly assume empty arrays are impossible? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Slice Conversion] The as_bytes() and to_bytes() methods at lines 354-363 return references and clones - could misuse of these APIs in consensus-critical paths introduce unnecessary allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Error Propagation] The from_hex method at line 532 returns Err(e) directly - if the hex_bytes function returns a generic error, could this hide important validation failure details? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Length Validation] At line 525, the check bytes.len() != $len should use BadLength error - if this returns HexError with the wrong error type, could error handling code misinterpret the failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Slice Bounds] In from_vec at line 562, the expression &inp[..inp.len()] is redundant but safe - could removing this introduce bugs if inp is a view into a larger buffer? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Duplicate Logic] The from_bytes and from_vec methods have nearly identical logic - could maintaining two implementations lead to divergence where one is patched but not the other? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_versioned_named_enum_internal!] [Copy Trait] At line 129, the enum derives Copy - if variants are added that don't implement Copy, could this cause compilation failures in dependent code? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_versioned_named_enum_internal!] [Const Arrays] The ALL and ALL_NAMES arrays at lines 135-136 are const - if these are very large, could they increase binary size or cause stack overflow when used? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_versioned_named_enum_internal!] [Version Comparison Order] At line 152, the check min_version <= version && version <= max_version uses && - could short-circuiting hide bugs where max_version is checked incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [UTF-8 Validation] Since the macro uses String at line 209, is UTF-8 validity checked before regex matching, or could invalid UTF-8 cause regex matching to behave incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [Type Parameter] The $MaxStringLength parameter is checked at line 213 - if this is specified as a non-literal expression, could it be evaluated at runtime instead of compile-time? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [Into<String>] The Into<String> implementation at lines 251-255 consumes self - could this prevent reuse of validated strings in contexts where ownership transfer is unintended? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_serde!] [Round-Trip Consistency] If a type uses both impl_byte_array_serde! and impl_byte_array_newtype!, does serialize -> deserialize -> serialize produce identical output? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Serialization Format] Since impl_array_newtype! doesn't define Serialize/Deserialize, if used with types that require serialization, could default derivations produce inconsistent formats? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_u8_enum!] [Exhaustiveness] If the ALL array at line 291 is used for iteration, but a u8 value maps to no variant, could from_u8 returning None cause unexpected panics in match statements? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Zero-Length Arrays] If $len is 0, could the comparison loop at line 417 skip all iterations, incorrectly returning Equal for any comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Empty Hex String] If from_hex is called with an empty string and $len is 0, does this correctly create a zero-length array or return an error? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Hash Performance] The hash_slice method at lines 445-452 iterates over all elements - if used with large arrays, could this cause performance issues in hash-based collections? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_newtype!] [Allocation Pattern] The from_vec_be method allocates a new array at line 575 - if called repeatedly in a hot loop, could this cause allocation pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: guarded_string!] [Regex Compilation] Is the $Regex parameter compiled once or on every is_match call at line 216 - could repeated validation cause performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_named_enum!] [Serde Attributes] The enum derives Serialize and Deserialize at line 53 - if serde uses string representation, could this conflict with the get_name() method? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: define_u8_enum!] [Repr Attribute] The #[repr(u8)] at line 283 affects memory layout - if this enum is used in FFI, could alignment differences cause ABI incompatibilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/macros.rs] [Macro: impl_array_newtype!] [Trait Derivation] Since Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Ord are manually implemented, could forgetting to derive other traits (e.g., Default) cause issues? (Low)"
