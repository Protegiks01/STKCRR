  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getcontractsrc.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Message Consistency] The error 'Chain tip not found' at line 171 is returned for both Ok(None) and Err(_) cases at line 168 - does this prevent proper debugging when actual errors (not just missing tips) occur? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getcontractsrc.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Response Validation] After parsing JSON at line 191, the ContractSrcResponse is directly returned without validating that source is non-empty, publish_height is reasonable, or marf_proof (if present) is valid hex - could invalid responses propagate through the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getcontractsrc.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Complexity] The nested closures with_node_state, maybe_read_only_clarity_tx, and with_clarity_db_readonly (lines 127-156) create deep nesting - could this complexity hide logic errors or make security-critical code paths hard to audit? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getcontractsrc.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Propagation] The ? operator is used inconsistently (line 129, 133) while some errors use ok().flatten() (lines 137, 142) - could this inconsistent error handling lead to unexpected control flow or missed error conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getcontractsrc.rs] [Function: decode_contract_src_response()] [Error Context] The DeserializeError at line 222 has a generic message 'Failed to load from JSON' - could this insufficient error detail make it hard to diagnose attacks or bugs involving malformed responses? (Low)"
