  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Selective Relay Attack] The code only relays if accepted==true, but can an attacker exploit timing differences in acceptance to learn about internal chainstate and selectively relay blocks that create forks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN Bypass] The check against MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN at line 95 happens after the body is already read into memory, so can an attacker cause memory exhaustion by sending many concurrent requests with bodies just under the limit? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Expensive Block Processing] The function calls Relayer::process_new_anchored_block at line 149 without any timeout or cost limit, allowing an attacker to submit blocks with maximum execution cost that tie up CPU for extended periods? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Sortition DB Query DoS] The sortition lookup at line 145 queries the database for every POST request, but is there rate limiting to prevent an attacker from exhausting DB connections with random consensus hashes? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: parse_postblock_octets()] [CPU Exhaustion via Complex Blocks] Does StacksBlock::consensus_deserialize have complexity bounds to prevent blocks with deeply nested transactions or excessive signature verifications from consuming unbounded CPU during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Path Resource Leak] When errors occur at lines 163, 191, or 196, are all resources (DB connections, locks, memory) properly released, or can repeated errors cause resource leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Database Error Information Leakage] The error messages at lines 164-169, 179-183, and 191-199 include detailed internal state like consensus hashes and error descriptions that could help an attacker map internal database structure? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Timing Side Channel] The different error paths (unrecognized consensus hash at line 178 vs. processing error at line 163) return different HTTP status codes (404 vs. 500), creating a timing oracle that reveals whether a consensus hash exists in the sortition DB? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Deserialization Error Verbosity] The error message at line 57 includes the full deserialization error message, but does this leak information about internal data structures or validation logic that could aid exploit development? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Acceptance Response Information] The response includes the accepted boolean at line 205, but does returning false for rejected blocks allow an attacker to probe which blocks are invalid and refine attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Response Deserialization] The function parses JSON at line 237 without validating that the stacks_block_id in the response matches the expected hash, allowing a malicious server to return incorrect block IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: decode_stacks_block_accepted()] [JSON Deserialization Failure] When serde_json::from_value fails at line 263, the error is converted to a generic DeserializeError, losing context about which field failed validation, making debugging difficult? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: new_post_block()] [Request Construction] The function at line 244 uses expect() on an infallible operation, but if the format string or payload_stacks() ever fail due to resource limits, this will panic the thread instead of returning an error? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Fork Choice Manipulation] When multiple blocks are POSTed with the same consensus hash but different content, does the processing order affect which block becomes canonical, allowing an attacker to manipulate fork choice by controlling POST timing? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block Timestamp Validation] Does Relayer::process_new_anchored_block validate that the block timestamp is consistent with the burnchain consensus hash, or can an attacker POST blocks with arbitrary timestamps that violate temporal ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Parent Block Verification] Is there verification that the parent_block_id in the posted block matches the expected tip for the given consensus hash, or can an attacker post orphan blocks that create invalid forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block Height Validation] Does the processing verify that the block height increments correctly from the parent, or can an attacker post blocks with incorrect heights that violate chain continuity? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Verification] When the block is accepted, is there verification that the miner is authorized for this tenure according to the burnchain sortition, or can unauthorized miners post blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [VRF Proof Validation] Does Relayer::process_new_anchored_block verify the VRF proof in the block header matches the sortition, or can this be bypassed by POSTing blocks directly to the API? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Query String Handling] The function passes query string at line 113, but is the query string validated or sanitized, or can it contain malicious data that affects downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Preamble Reuse] The preamble is borrowed at line 127 and reused at multiple error sites (lines 172, 186, 197, 224), but is there risk of the preamble being modified during processing, causing inconsistent responses? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Regex Complexity] The regex at line 73 is compiled with unwrap(), but is there a risk of catastrophic backtracking on malformed URLs that could cause CPU exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: new_post_block()] [Payload Encoding] The function calls payload_stacks() at line 253 to encode the block, but is there verification that the encoding is deterministic and matches what parse_postblock_octets expects? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Node State Callback Safety] The with_node_state closure at line 144 accesses multiple mutable state components (sortdb, chainstate), but is there protection against the closure panicking and leaving state partially modified? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Downloaded Parameter Semantics] The hardcoded downloaded=0 parameter at line 154 suggests this block is locally generated, but POSTed blocks are externally sourced - does this mismatch affect validation rigor or network propagation logic? (High)"
