  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/keys.rs] [Type Alias: BitcoinPublicKey] [Type Safety] Does the type alias BitcoinPublicKey provide sufficient semantic distinction from the underlying Secp256k1PublicKey to prevent misuse in Bitcoin-specific burnchain operations where a different key type might be required, potentially leading to signature verification bypass or consensus divergence? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/keys.rs] [Type Alias: BitcoinPublicKey] [Consensus Safety] Could the direct aliasing to Secp256k1PublicKey without additional wrapper validation allow Bitcoin public keys to be used interchangeably with Stacks public keys in contexts where they should be distinct, leading to cross-chain replay attacks or incorrect address derivation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/keys.rs] [Type Alias: BitcoinPublicKey] [Key Validation] Does the lack of any validation wrapper around the Secp256k1PublicKey type alias mean that invalid or malformed Bitcoin public keys could propagate through the burnchain layer without proper format checking, potentially causing consensus divergence if different nodes reject/accept different key formats? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/keys.rs] [Import: secp256k1] [Dependency Trust] Does relying solely on the stacks_common::util::secp256k1 implementation without any Bitcoin-specific validation or formatting in this file create a dependency risk where changes to the underlying Secp256k1PublicKey implementation could break Bitcoin burnchain compatibility or introduce consensus bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/keys.rs] [Type Alias: BitcoinPublicKey] [Serialization] Does the type alias inherit all serialization/deserialization behavior from Secp256k1PublicKey without Bitcoin-specific encoding requirements (compressed vs uncompressed, specific prefix bytes), potentially leading to non-canonical representations that cause burnchain transaction parsing failures or consensus divergence? (High)"
