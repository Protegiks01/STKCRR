  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [HTTP Request Smuggling] Can an attacker exploit the simultaneous presence of both Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding: chunked headers by sending them in a specific order that bypasses the check at line 574-579, causing response splitting or smuggling attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Duplicate Header DoS] Can an attacker cause a denial of service by sending duplicate headers that are not detected by the seen_headers HashSet due to case-sensitivity mismatches or Unicode normalization issues before line 531-536? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Header Injection] Can an attacker inject CRLF sequences (\\r\\n) within header values to inject additional headers or response splitting, given that the validation at lines 518-522 only checks is_ascii() but not for control characters?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Content-Type Confusion] Can an attacker send a Content-Type header that parses successfully into HttpContentType but has additional parameters or encodings that cause downstream payload parsing to misinterpret the data format at line 540-541? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Connection Handling Bypass] Can an attacker send a Connection header with mixed case or trailing whitespace (e.g., 'Keep-Alive ' or 'CLOSE') that bypasses the exact string matching at lines 551-559, causing keep-alive state confusion?

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Missing Encoding Validation] When neither content_length nor chunked_encoding is set (line 581-585), can an attacker send a response with an actual body that gets parsed incorrectly, leading to buffer underflow or message truncation?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: read_to_crlf2()] [DoS via Slow Read] Can an attacker send bytes one at a time up to HTTP_PREAMBLE_MAX_ENCODED_SIZE without ever sending the \\r\\n\\r\\n sequence, causing the function to consume maximum memory and CPU time before returning an error? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: read_to_crlf2()] [Buffer Overflow Risk] Can the byte-by-byte reading at lines 361-363 combined with the push at line 363 cause a buffer overflow if the Vec reallocation strategy is inefficient or if the capacity check at line 360 has an off-by-one error? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: read_to_crlf2()] [CRLF Pattern Spoofing] Can an attacker send a sequence like \\r\\n\\r\\x00 that matches the last_chunk::<4>() pattern check at line 365-369 but doesn't actually represent a proper CRLF terminator, causing premature parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [HTTP Version Confusion] When the HTTP version is parsed from httparse at lines 481-492, can an attacker send a version number outside 0-1 range that causes integer overflow or is accepted after type coercion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Status Code Manipulation] Can an attacker send a status code outside the standard HTTP range (e.g., 999 or negative) that bypasses validation at line 494-496 and causes downstream logic to behave incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Reason Phrase Injection] Can an attacker inject control characters or Unicode in the reason phrase (lines 497-502) that bypass ASCII validation and are later used in consensus-critical logging or state transitions?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: consensus_deserialize()] [Underscore in Headers] Can an attacker use underscore-to-hyphen normalization issues in header names (line 529) to bypass duplicate header detection or reserved header checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/response.rs] [Function: add_header()] [Reserved Header Bypass] Can an attacker bypass reserved header filtering at lines 283-303 by sending headers with non-lowercase names that don't match the to_lowercase() comparison but are still processed?
