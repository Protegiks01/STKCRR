  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/poststackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [DoS - Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker send a request with content-length header set to exactly MAX_MESSAGE_LEN (33,554,432 bytes) to force the node to allocate maximum memory repeatedly, causing memory exhaustion when multiple concurrent requests are made? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/poststackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation Bypass] Does the content-length check at line 75 properly validate against the actual body length, or can an attacker send a mismatched content-length header with a smaller body to bypass size restrictions? (Medium)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/poststackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Can request::get_contract_address() at line 87 return an invalid or malicious contract identifier that passes regex validation but causes issues in try_handle_request()? (Medium)",
