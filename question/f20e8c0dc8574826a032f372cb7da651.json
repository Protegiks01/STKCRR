  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [Neighbor is_always_allowed method] [Permanent Allow Bypass] The is_always_allowed method (lines 1457-1459) checks for negative allowed values - could incorrectly setting allowed = -1 bypass all future access control checks for a malicious peer? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [Neighbor asn and org fields] [ASN Spoofing] The asn and org fields (lines 1435-1436) track network identity - could an attacker spoof these values to bypass ASN-based rate limiting or peer selection policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [Neighbor in_degree and out_degree] [Degree Manipulation] The in_degree and out_degree fields (lines 1438-1439) track connectivity - could a peer manipulate these values to appear more well-connected than it actually is, affecting peer selection algorithms? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeerConfig default method] [Test Configuration Leakage] The TestPeerConfig default (lines 2654-2680) sets specific test values - could any of these test defaults (e.g., deny=0, allowed=0) accidentally be used in production, weakening security? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeer new method] [Test Peer State Initialization] The TestPeer new method (lines 2794-3039) sets up a complete peer network - could improper cleanup of test peers cause port exhaustion or resource leaks in test environments? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeer make_next_burnchain_block method] [Block Time Manipulation] The make_next_burnchain_block method (lines 3486-3536) uses BURNCHAIN_TEST_BLOCK_TIME constant - could deterministic test block times mask time-dependent bugs that only appear with real block time variance? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeer inner_next_burnchain_block method] [Sortition Hash Manipulation] The inner_next_burnchain_block method (lines 3577-3666) allows setting consensus hashes on operations - could test code that manipulates consensus hashes reveal vulnerabilities in how production code validates these hashes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeer preprocess_stacks_block method] [Block Preprocessing Validation] The preprocess_stacks_block method (lines 3670-3732) stages blocks without full validation - could calling this in production code bypass consensus checks that should happen before block acceptance? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [TestPeer make_tenure method] [Tenure Building Logic] The make_tenure method (lines 4141-4284) creates complete tenures with custom builder functions - could the flexibility of this approach allow test code to create invalid tenures that wouldn't be possible in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [ProtocolFamily trait preamble_size_hint method] [Size Hint Accuracy] The preamble_size_hint method (line 1234) returns a maximum size - could implementations return an incorrect hint, causing buffer overruns or underruns during message parsing? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [ProtocolFamily trait payload_len method] [Payload Length Validation] The payload_len method (line 1238) may return None if length cannot be determined from preamble - could this lead to streaming parsers that never terminate, exhausting resources? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [ProtocolFamily trait read_preamble method] [Preamble Parsing Buffer] The read_preamble method (line 1242) takes a byte buffer - if the buffer is smaller than preamble_size_hint, could this cause out-of-bounds reads? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [ProtocolFamily trait stream_payload method] [Streaming State Management] The stream_payload method (lines 1258-1262) is called repeatedly until a message is obtained - could improper state management cause the same payload data to be processed multiple times? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [ProtocolFamily trait verify_payload_bytes method] [Payload Verification Bypass] The verify_payload_bytes method (lines 1266-1271) is noted as not required for all protocols - could protocols that skip verification be exploited to inject malicious payloads? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [NetworkResult transactions method] [Transaction Collection] The transactions method (lines 2113-2120) collects transactions from multiple sources by cloning - could very large transaction sets cause memory exhaustion when cloning all transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [NetworkResult has_data_to_store method] [Data Storage Decision] The has_data_to_store method (lines 2122-2129) determines if data needs storing - could this return false positives if any component has data, even if that data is invalid? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [NUM_NEIGHBORS constant] [Neighbor Table Size] The NUM_NEIGHBORS constant of 32 (line 1474) limits the neighbor table - could this small limit be exploited to fill the table with malicious peers, preventing connections to honest nodes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [GETPOXINV_MAX_BITLEN constant] [PoX Inventory Bounds] The GETPOXINV_MAX_BITLEN is 4096 in production and 8 in tests (lines 1297-1300) - could the test value being much smaller mask bugs that only appear when querying full 4096-bit inventories? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [DropNeighbor Hash implementation] [Hash Ignores Metadata] The Hash implementation for DropNeighbor (lines 1323-1328) only hashes the key, ignoring reason and source - could this cause incorrect set membership checks if reason/source matter for deduplication? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [DropNeighbor PartialEq implementation] [Equality Ignores Metadata] The PartialEq for DropNeighbor (lines 1330-1334) only compares keys - could this cause issues if the same neighbor needs to be dropped for multiple different reasons? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [StacksMessageType enum variants] [Message Type Exhaustiveness] The StacksMessageType enum (lines 1144-1176) has 22 variants - is there handling for unknown or future message types, or would new message types cause deserialization failures on older nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [StacksMessageID enum Reserved variant] [Reserved Message Handling] The StacksMessageID has a Reserved = 255 variant (line 1212) - could receiving a message with ID 255 cause unexpected behavior if this is treated as a valid message type? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [StacksMessageID gaps] [Message ID Gaps] The StacksMessageID enum has gaps (e.g., no ID 20) - could messages with these undefined IDs be processed incorrectly or cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [Requestable trait get_url method] [URL Reference Lifetime] The get_url method (line 2236) returns a reference to UrlString - could the URL be invalidated while still being used to make requests? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/mod.rs] [Requestable trait make_request_type method] [Request Type Consistency] The make_request_type method (line 2238) creates a request from a peer host - could mismatched peer hosts and URLs cause requests to be sent to incorrect endpoints? (Medium)"
