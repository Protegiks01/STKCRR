  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: run_git_command()] [Command Injection] Could an attacker with write access to the git repository inject malicious content into commit messages or branch names that gets executed when the Command output is processed, potentially compromising the build environment? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: run_git_command()] [Command Injection] If the CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR environment variable is controlled or modified by an attacker, could this cause git commands to execute in an unintended directory, potentially leaking sensitive information or executing malicious hooks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: run_git_command()] [Output Handling] Does the unwrap_or(None) pattern mask command execution failures that could indicate a compromised build environment, allowing builds to proceed with potentially malicious default values? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: current_git_hash()] [Information Disclosure] Could the git log command expose sensitive information from commit messages that should not be embedded in the compiled binary, violating information disclosure policies? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: current_git_branch()] [Branch Name Injection] If a malicious branch name contains shell metacharacters, newlines, or control characters, could these be improperly handled when embedded in generated code or environment variables, leading to code injection? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: is_working_tree_clean()] [Logic Error] The function returns true on command failure via unwrap_or(true) - could an attacker trigger command failures to make a dirty working tree appear clean, masking unauthorized modifications to consensus-critical code? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: is_working_tree_clean()] [Status Code Validation] Does checking only for status code 0 miss other git diff failure modes that could indicate repository corruption or manipulation, allowing compromised builds? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Traversal] The hardcoded relative path '../versions.toml' could be exploited if the build is executed from an unexpected directory - could this cause the script to read a malicious TOML file from an attacker-controlled location? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [File Read] The fs::read_to_string() call has no size limit - could an attacker create an extremely large versions.toml file to cause memory exhaustion during the build process, creating a denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Path Injection] If the OUT_DIR environment variable is manipulated, could the generated versions.rs file be written to an attacker-controlled location, potentially overwriting critical system files or injecting malicious code? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Symbolic Link Attack] Does the script verify that '../versions.toml' and the OUT_DIR path are not symbolic links that could redirect file operations to unintended locations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [File Permissions] Are there checks to ensure the generated versions.rs file has appropriate permissions and cannot be modified by unauthorized processes after creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [TOML Injection] When parsing versions.toml, are there any restrictions on the TOML structure complexity that could cause the parser to consume excessive resources or crash, disrupting the build process? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Type Validation] The code only validates that table values are strings via pattern matching - could an attacker craft a TOML file with nested tables, arrays, or other complex structures that bypass this validation and cause panics? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Key Validation] TOML keys are converted to uppercase Rust identifiers without sanitization - could keys containing Unicode characters, special symbols, or Rust keywords cause compilation errors or inject malicious identifiers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Reserved Keywords] Could a malicious versions.toml define keys that collide with Rust reserved keywords (e.g., 'pub', 'const', 'let') causing the generated code to fail compilation or exhibit unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Identifier Collision] If versions.toml contains keys that convert to the same uppercase identifier (e.g., 'git_commit' and 'GIT_COMMIT'), could this create duplicate constant definitions causing compilation failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Empty Key Validation] Are empty string keys in versions.toml properly validated, or could they result in invalid Rust identifiers being generated? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Code Injection] The format! macro uses {:?} debug formatting for string values - could specially crafted strings in versions.toml containing escape sequences, quotes, or control characters break out of the string literal and inject arbitrary Rust code? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [String Escaping] Does the Debug formatting ({:?}) properly escape all characters that could break Rust string literal syntax, including Unicode normalization attacks and homoglyph substitution? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Comment Injection] Could a malicious TOML value contain Rust comment syntax (//, /*) that when embedded in generated code, comments out subsequent critical constants or injects malicious logic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Macro Injection] Could TOML values containing Rust macro invocation syntax (e.g., 'include!', 'env!') be embedded in generated constants in a way that causes unintended macro expansion at compile time? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Attribute Injection] Could malicious strings inject Rust attributes (e.g., '#[cfg]', '#[allow]') into the generated code that modify compilation behavior or disable security checks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Line Break Injection] Although {:?} escapes newlines, could specially crafted multi-line strings or raw string literals in TOML cause unexpected code structure in the generated output? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/build.rs] [Function: main()] [Environment Pollution] Git commit hash and branch values are set as cargo environment variables without validation - could malicious git metadata inject environment variables that affect other parts of the build process? (High)"
