  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Can a maliciously crafted principal string that passes the PRINCIPAL_DATA_REGEX_STRING but fails PrincipalData::parse() cause a panic or undefined behavior instead of returning a proper DecodeError? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [DoS] Does the regex matching in path_regex() have catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities when processing extremely long or specially crafted principal strings that could cause CPU exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker bypass the content-length check by sending a request with Content-Length header set to 0 but still include a body, potentially causing inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [State Management] If captures.name('principal') returns None despite regex matching, could this lead to an incorrect error message or leak internal state information? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Memory Safety] When PrincipalData::parse() is called on the captured value, can an attacker craft a principal that consumes excessive memory during parsing, leading to OOM conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consensus Safety] If load_stacks_chain_tip() returns a tip that becomes stale during the subsequent clarity_tx execution, can this cause the response to reflect an inconsistent state between balance and nonce? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Race Condition] Between loading the chain tip and executing the read-only clarity transaction, if a new block is processed, can this lead to querying state that no longer corresponds to the reported tip? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Handling] If maybe_read_only_clarity_tx() returns Ok(None), the code treats it as if the chain tip doesn't exist - could this incorrectly reject valid requests for accounts on legitimate chain tips? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Consistency] Can sortdb.index_handle_at_block() and the clarity_tx operate on different sortition views, causing balance/nonce reads to be inconsistent with the burn block height used? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Integer Overflow] When calling balance.get_available_balance_at_burn_block(), if the burn_block_height value overflows or is near u64::MAX, can this cause incorrect unlock calculations or panics? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Balance Corruption] If get_current_burnchain_block_height() returns an error and gets silently converted to None via ok()?, can this cause the balance calculation to use a default/zero height, showing incorrect unlocked amounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Consistency] Can mismatches between v1_unlock_height, v2_unlock_height, and v3_unlock_height cause incorrect balance calculations if an account's STXBalance variant doesn't match the expected PoX version? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Integer Underflow] When get_available_balance_at_burn_block() calculates unlocked amounts, can integer underflows occur if amount_locked exceeds total balance due to database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Balance Invariant] Can get_locked_balance_at_burn_block() return a locked amount that exceeds the total balance stored in the STXBalance structure, violating the invariant that locked + unlocked = total? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Serialization] When converting unlocked and locked balances to hex via to_be_bytes(), can u128 values overflow the expected 16-byte representation, causing truncation or incorrect balance reporting? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Proof Integrity] When with_proof is true and get_data_with_proof() returns None for an existing account, does returning an empty string proof ('') allow clients to falsely verify non-existent accounts? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Proof Consistency] Can the balance_proof and nonce_proof be generated from different MARF snapshots if a state transition occurs between the two get_data_with_proof() calls, making them unverifiable together? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] When proof generation fails and returns None, does the fallback to STXBalance::zero() with empty proof leak information about database errors vs. genuinely non-existent accounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Proof Verification] Are the proofs generated deterministic and verifiable against a specific MARF root hash, or can malicious nodes provide valid-looking but unverifiable proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Root Binding] Do the proofs include or reference the specific state root they prove against, preventing attacks where old proofs are replayed for current state queries? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Nonce Consistency] If the nonce read via get_data() fails but returns Ok(None) instead of Err, does defaulting to 0 allow transaction replay attacks for accounts that should have higher nonces? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Nonce Overflow] Can the nonce value overflow u64 bounds, and if so, does the API properly handle or reject such accounts, or could it wrap around causing transaction validation issues? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Consistency] Are nonce reads atomic with balance reads within the clarity_db transaction, or can concurrent transactions cause the nonce to be from a different state than the balance? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Handling] When account.take() is called and returns None, the error message says 'Missing `account`' - can this state be reached in normal operation, indicating a logic bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does the HttpNotFound error message 'Chain tip not found' leak information about internal chain state that could help an attacker probe for reorg conditions? (Low)"
