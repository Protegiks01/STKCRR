  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: connect()] [Buffer Size Attack] In production mode, can an attacker specify extremely large socket_send_buffer or socket_recv_buffer values at lines 344-361, causing memory exhaustion or kernel resource depletion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: connect()] [Test Mode Vulnerability] Does the hardcoded buffer size of 32 bytes at lines 339-340 in test mode cause different behavior that could hide production bugs or create test-specific vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: connect()] [Keep-Alive Misconfiguration] Can the 7200-second keepalive at line 330 allow zombie connections to persist too long, exhausting connection slots during DoS attacks? (Medium)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: connect()] [Integer Casting] Can the u32 to usize casts at lines 344 and 354 for buffer sizes cause truncation on 64-bit systems with very large buffer values? (Low)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Accept Loop DoS] Can the infinite accept loop at lines 404-446 be exploited by rapidly connecting and disconnecting, causing the server to spin indefinitely accepting connections without processing existing ones? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Event ID Exhaustion] Can the TooManyPeers check at lines 420-427 be bypassed by filling new_events HashSet but not event_map, allowing connections beyond capacity? (High)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/poll.rs] [Function: poll()] [Panic in Production] Can the panic at lines 398-401 be triggered in production if poll_state.get_mut() fails for a valid server token, causing node crash? (Critical)",
