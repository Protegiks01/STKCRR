  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: decode_stacker_set()] [Deserialization] The serde_json::from_value() call on line 241 maps JSON decode errors to a generic 'Failed to decode JSON' message on line 242 - can this mask important validation failures that should cause the node to reject the response? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: decode_stacker_set()] [Type Safety] The response is first parsed as generic serde_json::Value on line 240, then deserialized to GetStackersResponse on line 241 - can this two-step process allow type confusion or bypass type-level validation that would occur with direct deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [DoS] The HttpResponseContents::try_from_json() on line 204 serializes the entire RewardSet - if the set contains thousands of stackers, can this cause excessive memory allocation or serialization time, enabling DoS through high-cost requests? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Race Condition] The with_node_state() closure on line 178 holds locks on network, sortdb, chainstate, mempool, and rpc_args - can concurrent getstackers requests deadlock with other operations that require these same locks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Consistency] The tip is loaded before with_node_state() on line 162, but used inside the closure on line 182 - can the chainstate advance between these points, causing the tip to become stale and result in inconsistent reward set retrieval? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Resource Exhaustion] The with_node_state() closure acquires multiple resources - if GetStackersResponse::load() performs expensive database queries or computation, can an attacker trigger resource exhaustion by sending many concurrent requests? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: new_getstackers()] [Input Validation] The cycle_num parameter on line 224 is formatted directly into the URL path on line 230 without validation - can a malicious caller pass a cycle_num that injects path traversal sequences or breaks the URL structure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: new_getstackers()] [Error Handling] The expect() on line 233 claims the request construction is infallible, but does the format!() on line 230 actually guarantee this, or can extreme cycle_num values cause formatting failures that panic? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: new_getstackers()] [Consistency] The client constructs requests with cycle_num as u64, but the server parses it with from_str_radix(radix 10) - are there any edge cases where the client's formatted number and server's parsed number could differ? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Input Validation] The regex on line 113 uses {1,10} to limit cycle_num to 10 digits - but does this properly prevent overflow when parsed as u64, since u64::MAX is 18446744073709551615 (20 digits)? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [DoS] Does the Regex::new().unwrap() on line 113 guarantee the regex compiles, or could future modifications to the pattern cause a runtime panic in production? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] If captures.name('cycle_num') returns Some but contains an empty string or whitespace-only content, will from_str_radix() properly reject it, or could it parse to an unintended value? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: verb()] [Protocol Violation] The endpoint only accepts GET requests on line 109 - but if an attacker sends POST/PUT with a body containing a different cycle_num, could any parsing logic incorrectly process the body instead of the path parameter? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [HTTP Smuggling] The content-length check on line 129 ensures the body is empty for GET requests - but can an attacker exploit HTTP request smuggling by providing both a path cycle_num and a body that bypasses this check? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Struct: GetStackersResponse] [Data Validation] The stacker_set field on line 41 contains a RewardSet - does this endpoint validate that the RewardSet contains only valid stacker entries with non-zero amounts and valid addresses? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Struct: GetStackersResponse] [Consensus Divergence] Can two nodes return different GetStackersResponse values for the same cycle_num and tip if their OnChainRewardSetProvider produces non-deterministic results? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [PoX Reward Distribution] If the reward set contains stackers with zero or negative amounts (through data corruption), will this endpoint expose invalid reward distribution data that conflicts with actual PoX payouts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Bitcoin Anchoring] The burnchain parameter on line 81 is used to calculate cycle_start_height on line 84 - if the burnchain configuration differs between nodes (e.g., different first_block_height), can this cause reward set divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [State Consistency] Does reward_cycle_to_block_height() on line 84 guarantee the same mapping across all nodes, or can different burnchain configurations cause nodes to return different reward sets for the same cycle_num? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Boundary Condition] If cycle_number is 0 or represents the genesis reward cycle, does reward_cycle_to_block_height() handle this correctly, or could it underflow and cause incorrect PoX contract selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] The query parameter is passed to HttpRequestContents::query_string() on line 145 but never validated - can an attacker inject unexpected query parameters that affect tip loading or state access? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Unused Parameters] The query parameter is stored but the cycle_num comes from the path - can this design confusion lead to scenarios where query parameters are mistakenly used instead of path parameters in future code modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Memory Exhaustion] The entire RewardSet is loaded into memory on line 179-185 and serialized on line 204 - for reward cycles with maximum stackers, could this cause excessive memory usage enabling memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: decode_stacker_set()] [Memory Safety] The get_http_payload_ok() call on line 239 extracts the payload - does this properly validate payload size to prevent loading extremely large malicious responses into memory? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: restart()] [State Cleanup] The restart() method on line 152 sets cycle_number to None - but are there scenarios where restart() is not called between requests, causing cycle_number from a previous request to leak into the next request? (High)"
