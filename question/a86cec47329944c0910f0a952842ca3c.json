  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: BlocksData::consensus_deserialize()] [Block Count Limit] At line 521, BLOCKS_PUSHED_MAX limits blocks, but if this constant is too large, could deserializing maximum blocks cause OOM or CPU exhaustion during duplicate checking? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: BlocksData::consensus_deserialize()] [BoundReader Usage] At line 520, BoundReader limits to MAX_MESSAGE_LEN, but is this the correct bound given that each block can be up to MAX_BLOCK_LEN, and could total size exceed MAX_MESSAGE_LEN? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: BlocksData::push()] [Unchecked Push] The push() method at lines 506-508 doesn't validate limits or check for duplicates - could this be called by internal code that bypasses try_push() style checks, introducing inconsistent blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: MicroblocksData::consensus_deserialize()] [No Length Limit] At lines 550-554, reading microblocks vector has no explicit count limit besides MAX_MESSAGE_LEN - could an attacker send thousands of tiny microblocks causing processing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: MicroblocksData::consensus_deserialize()] [No Duplicate Detection] Unlike BlocksData, MicroblocksData doesn't check for duplicate microblocks - could an attacker send duplicate microblocks causing wasted processing or consensus confusion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: MicroblocksData::consensus_deserialize()] [Anchor Block Validation] The index_anchor_block is read but not validated - could an attacker provide a non-existent or malformed anchor block reference causing downstream failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NeighborAddress::from_neighbor()] [Public Key Hash Trust] At line 568, Hash160::from_node_public_key() is called, but does this properly validate the public key format, or could malformed keys produce misleading hashes? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NeighborAddress::consensus_deserialize()] [Port Zero Allowed] Unlike HandshakeData which rejects port 0, NeighborAddress deserialization doesn't validate port - could port 0 cause connection failures or be exploited for reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NeighborAddress::consensus_deserialize()] [Public Key Hash Validation] The public_key_hash is read but not validated - could an all-zeros or invalid hash cause identity confusion in neighbor tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NeighborsData::consensus_deserialize()] [Neighbor Count Limit] At line 603, MAX_NEIGHBORS_DATA_LEN limits neighbors, but what is this value, and could an attacker send maximum neighbors repeatedly causing memory pressure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NeighborsData::consensus_deserialize()] [Duplicate Neighbors] Does deserialization check for duplicate NeighborAddress entries, or could an attacker fill the list with the same neighbor, causing inefficient peer discovery? (Low)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeData::from_local_peer()] [URL Construction] At line 620, UrlString::try_from constructs data URL from addrbytes - if addrbytes contains malicious content (e.g., IPv6 injection), could this create invalid URLs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Port Zero Rejection] At lines 654-658, port == 0 is rejected, but does this prevent legitimate use cases, and could an attacker exploit the error path to fingerprint nodes? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Public Key Validation] At line 661, node_public_key is read as StacksPublicKeyBuffer, but is the key validated for correctness (e.g., not zero, on curve), or could invalid keys be accepted? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Expire Block Height] The expire_block_height at line 662 is read but not validated - could an attacker set this to 0 or u64::MAX causing key expiration logic to malfunction? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Data URL Validation] The data_url at line 663 is read but not validated for length or format - could an extremely long or malformed URL cause buffer overflow or DoS in URL parsing? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeAcceptData::new()] [Heartbeat Interval] At line 679, heartbeat_interval is set from parameter but not validated - could a 0 or excessively large interval cause heartbeat failures or timing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: HandshakeAcceptData::consensus_deserialize()] [Nested Validation] HandshakeAcceptData contains HandshakeData, so all HandshakeData vulnerabilities apply - are both levels properly validated during deserialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: NackData::consensus_deserialize()] [Error Code Validation] The error_code is read but not validated against known error codes - could an attacker send arbitrary codes causing misinterpretation of errors? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: PingData::new()] [Nonce Uniqueness] At lines 721-723, nonce is generated with rand::thread_rng().gen(), but is this cryptographically secure, or could predictable nonces allow replay attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: PongData::from_ping()] [Nonce Echo] At line 741, the nonce is copied from PingData, but is there any validation that the pong nonce matches a pending ping, or could an attacker send unsolicited pongs? (Low)",
