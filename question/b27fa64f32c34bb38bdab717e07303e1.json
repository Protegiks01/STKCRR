  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay VecDeque Ordering] Replay txs converted to VecDeque - can ordering be manipulated to bypass replay validation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Builder State Leak] A separate replay_builder and replay_chainstate are created - can state differences cause validation inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Tenure Change Bypass in Replay] TenureChange and Coinbase transactions are allowed to break replay matching - can attackers inject these to bypass replay checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Transaction TXID Comparison] The check replay_tx.txid() == tx.txid() can be bypassed if TXID calculation is manipulable - can transaction malleability exploit this? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Cost Error Classification] Cost errors cause rejection while other errors allow tx to be dropped - can attackers exploit error type confusion? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Set Exhaustion Logic] The function returns true if no_replay_txs_remaining OR only_unmineable_remaining - can attackers craft blocks that falsely exhaust the set? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Transaction Pushback] When cost limit reached, tx is pushed back to front with push_front - can this cause infinite loops or validation hangs? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Unmineable Transaction Determination] The only_unmineable_remaining check tests all remaining txs - can this be exploited for DoS with large replay sets? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Replay Success Mismatch] If replay_tx mines successfully but isn't in block, it's rejected - can legitimate tx ordering differences cause false rejections? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate_replay()] [Total Receipts Overflow in Replay] The total_receipts counter could overflow in the replay validation loop - can this bypass cost limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: spawn_validation_thread()] [Thread Spawn Resource Exhaustion] Can attackers rapidly submit proposals to spawn threads until system resources are exhausted? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: spawn_validation_thread()] [Thread Ownership Transfer] The thread takes ownership of sortdb and chainstate - can this cause use-after-free or data races? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Proposal Thread Running Check] The is_proposal_thread_running check returns 429 - but can race conditions allow multiple threads to start? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block Age Validation Bypass] Block age checked with saturating_add and timestamp comparison - can integer saturation allow old blocks to pass? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Chainstate Reopen Race] chainstate.reopen() and sortdb.reopen() are called - can reopen fail intermittently causing inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Callback Receiver Missing] If get_proposal_callback_receiver returns None, request fails - can this be exploited to prevent valid block proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Validation Time Measurement Overflow] validation_time_ms uses try_from with unwrap_or(u64::MAX) - can extremely long validations overflow causing incorrect metrics? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Transaction Fees Overflow] The fold operation calculating tx fees with saturating_add could hide actual fee overflow - can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Instant Overflow] start.elapsed().as_millis() could overflow - can very long validations break time tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: fault_injection_validation_delay()] [Test Flag Exploitation] TEST_VALIDATE_DELAY_DURATION_SECS can pause validation - can this be exploited in production if test features leak? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: fault_injection_reject_replay_txs()] [Test Rejection Override] TEST_REJECT_REPLAY_TXS can force rejection - can test features accidentally be enabled in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Test Stall Infinite Loop] TEST_VALIDATE_STALL causes infinite loop with sleep - can this cause permanent DoS if triggered? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Enum: ValidateRejectCode] [Reject Code Exhaustion] Only 11 reject codes defined (0-10) - can new error conditions be misclassified causing incorrect rejection handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_from() for ValidateRejectCode] [Invalid Code Deserialization] Unknown u8 values cause DeserializeError - can attackers trigger deserialize errors to DoS the validation system? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: signer_signature_hash()] [Response Hash Leakage] Both Ok and Reject responses include signer_signature_hash - can this leak information about rejected blocks? (Low)"
