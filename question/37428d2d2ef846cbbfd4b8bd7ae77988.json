  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/metrics.rs] [Function: UnitMetric::from_cost_and_len()] [FIFO Exploitation] When UnitMetric is used and all transactions return 1 at line 98, does block assembly degrade to FIFO ordering allowing attackers to front-run by submitting transactions first? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/metrics.rs] [Function: ProportionalDotProduct::from_cost_and_len()] [Metric Collision] Can different combinations of cost and tx_len produce identical scalar values at line 79, causing incorrect fee-rate-based ordering? (Medium)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/metrics.rs] [Function: ProportionalDotProduct::from_cost_and_len()] [Negative Cost] Can ExecutionCost fields be negative (if represented as signed internally), and would this cause undefined behavior in proportion_dot_product at line 77? (Medium)",
