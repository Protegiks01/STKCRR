  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: get_burnchain()] [State Consistency] The function expects burnchain to be Some after start() is called. Can partial initialization cause get_burnchain to panic while other parts assume burnchain exists? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: get_pox_watchdog()] [Mutable Borrow] This function returns &mut PoxSyncWatchdog. Can multiple mutable borrows cause undefined behavior if called from multiple threads? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: is_miner()] [Default Behavior] The function returns self.is_miner.unwrap_or(false). Can defaulting to false cause the node to miss mining opportunities if is_miner is not yet initialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: start()] [Data Transfer] Neon2NakaData is created and returned for clean shutdown. If the node shuts down in an inconsistent state, can this data cause Nakamoto runloop to start with incorrect assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: start()] [Thread Join] coordinator_thread_handle.join().unwrap() is called during shutdown. If the coordinator thread panicked, can this propagate the panic and prevent proper cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: start()] [Peer Network Join] node.join() returns peer_network which is included in Neon2NakaData. Can race conditions in node shutdown cause peer_network to contain stale or inconsistent data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: new()] [Event Dispatcher] event_dispatcher.process_pending_payloads() is called during initialization. Can pending events from a previous run cause incorrect initialization state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: instantiate_pox_watchdog()] [PoX Watchdog Creation] The watchdog is created with .expect('FATAL: failed to instantiate PoX sync watchdog'). Can configuration errors cause this to panic after partial node initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: start_prometheus()] [Monitoring Thread] If prometheus_bind is Some but the thread fails to start, can this cause monitoring_thread to be None while prometheus_bind indicates it should exist? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: start()] [Burnchain DB Tip] The code gets burnchain_db_tip from the database then waits for sortitions up to that height. Can a race between getting the tip and waiting cause the node to wait for blocks that don't exist yet? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/run_loop/neon.rs] [Function: spawn_chains_coordinator()] [Indexer Creation] make_bitcoin_indexer is called with should_keep_running. Can the indexer continue running after shutdown is requested, causing database writes after cleanup? (Medium)"
