  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch2_blocks()] [Broadcast Error] Does the broadcast_message error at line 2551 for unconfirmed microblocks get handled, or can failures accumulate causing message queue growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_epoch2_blocks()] [IBD Bypass] Can the ibd check at line 2596 be bypassed by manipulating the ibd flag to force block relay during initial block download, causing network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_epoch2_blocks()] [Peer Banning Error] Does the ban_peers error at line 2591 prevent valid blocks from being relayed if peer banning fails? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_nakamoto_blocks()] [Downloaded Block Isolation] Do downloaded Nakamoto blocks at lines 2029-2047 get processed with empty relayers list, preventing proper propagation tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_nakamoto_blocks()] [Uploaded Block Coordinator] Does the coord_comms.inspect at line 2088 correctly notify the coordinator for http-uploaded blocks, or can notification failures cause coordinator desync? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_nakamoto_blocks()] [Block Count Overflow] Can the try_into().unwrap_or(u64::MAX) at line 2778 mask errors where more than u64::MAX blocks are received, hiding potential memory issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::get_last_n_sortitions()] [Sortition Chain Walk] Can the saturating_sub(1) at line 2627 cause incorrect sortition retrieval if n=0, and does NotFoundError at line 2633 properly handle chain tip access failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch3_blocks()] [Tenure Age Check] Can an attacker manipulate relay_tenures HashSet at line 2668 to include old tenures, causing relay of stale blocks and wasting bandwidth? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch3_blocks()] [Recently Sent Check] Can the recently_sent_nakamoto_blocks check at lines 2692-2700 be bypassed by sending blocks with slightly modified timestamps, allowing repeated relay? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch3_blocks()] [Push Interval] Can nakamoto_push_interval_ms at line 2694 be set to 0 to disable rate limiting, enabling DoS through excessive block relay? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch3_blocks()] [Block ID Insertion] Does inserting block_id at line 2727 update the timestamp correctly, or can stale timestamps persist causing blocks to be re-relayed unnecessarily? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::relay_epoch3_blocks()] [Garbage Collection] Can the retain at line 2742 incorrectly remove blocks that should still be tracked if relay_tenures is missing a tenure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/relay.rs] [Function: Relayer::process_new_epoch3_blocks()] [Ban Peers Error] Does ban_peers error at line 2785 prevent block relay even if banning fails, or does relay proceed despite the error? (Low)"
