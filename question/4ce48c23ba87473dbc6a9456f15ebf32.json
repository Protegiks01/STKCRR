  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Cross-Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots() and get-signers()] [Data Consistency] stackerdb-set-signer-slots sets slot assignments while set-signers sets weights - if these have mismatched principals, could get-signers() return signers who don't have slot assignments? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Cross-Function: get-signer-by-index() and get-signers()] [Index Validity] get-signer-by-index uses element-at on the list returned by cycle-signer-set - if the list is modified between calls, could indices become invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Cross-Function: stackerdb-get-signer-slots-page() and stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Page Selection] Page selection uses `(mod reward-cycle u2)` while reading uses explicit page numbers - is there a coordination mechanism ensuring readers use the correct page number for a given cycle? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [List Size: 4000 entries] [Memory Exhaustion] Both signer lists can hold 4000 entries - what is the total memory footprint of this data structure, and could loading it repeatedly cause memory exhaustion on resource-constrained nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [List Size: 4000 entries] [Iteration Cost] If functions iterate over these 4000-entry lists, what is the execution cost, and could this exceed block cost limits? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [List Size: 4000 entries] [Realistic Bounds] Is 4000 signers realistic for expected PoX participation, or is this an arbitrary large number that could be exploited by creating unnecessary entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Consensus: Reward Cycle Transitions] If signer sets are updated at cycle boundaries, can race conditions occur where different nodes transition at slightly different block heights, causing temporary forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Consensus: Determinism] Are all operations in this contract deterministic, or could non-deterministic behavior (e.g., map iteration order) cause nodes to compute different state roots? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Consensus: Signer Weight Changes] If signer weights change mid-cycle, could this invalidate signatures or votes that were valid under the old weights, causing consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Consensus: Cycle Skipping] If cycles are not set sequentially (e.g., cycle 5 then cycle 7, skipping 6), does the contract handle gaps correctly, or could this cause lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [PoX Integration: Reward Distribution] If the signer list stored here is used for STX reward distribution, can incorrect weights cause rewards to be distributed to the wrong signers or in wrong proportions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [PoX Integration: Stacking Threshold] If signer weights represent stacked STX amounts, is there validation that weights meet minimum stacking thresholds, or could under-stacked signers be registered? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [PoX Integration: Cycle Preparation] Signer sets should be finalized before a cycle begins - can late updates to a cycle's signers cause already-active cycles to use inconsistent configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Voting: Threshold Calculation] If signer weights are used to calculate voting thresholds (e.g., 70% of total weight), can incorrect weight values cause thresholds to be set too low or too high? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Voting: Weight Manipulation] Can a signer register multiple times with different principals but the same keys, multiplying their effective voting weight? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Signature Aggregation: Signer Identification] If signatures are aggregated using the signer list order, can reordering the list invalidate existing signatures or cause them to be attributed to wrong signers? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [StackerDB: Message Routing] The num-slots field determines how many stackerdb slots each signer gets - if this is always u1 as per the comment, why is it a variable field rather than a constant? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [StackerDB: Slot Allocation] If num-slots can be greater than u1, how are slots allocated, and could overlapping or conflicting slot assignments occur? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [StackerDB: Write Permissions] Does storing a signer in this contract automatically grant them write permissions to the stackerdb, and could unauthorized writes occur if the signer list is manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Edge Case: Cycle u0] Cycle u0 is used as both the default value for last-set-cycle and potentially a valid cycle - can this cause ambiguity or incorrect behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Edge Case: Empty Lists] Can empty lists be set for signer-slots or signers, and would downstream consumers handle empty lists correctly or crash? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Edge Case: Max Uint Values] Can reward-cycle, signer-index, or weight be set to uint max, and would this cause overflow in arithmetic operations by consumers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Edge Case: Invalid Principals] Is there validation that signer principals are valid addresses and not contracts, burn addresses, or other special principals? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Upgrade: State Migration] If this contract is upgraded, how is existing state in cycle-signer-set and cycle-set-height migrated, or would it be lost? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Upgrade: Backward Compatibility] If the list size or record structure changes in an upgrade, would old data be readable, or would it cause parsing errors? (Medium)"
