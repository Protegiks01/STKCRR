  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Debug Output] The Debug implementations for VRFPrivateKey and VRFPublicKey output hex strings - could this leak private keys through debug logs, and should VRFPrivateKey's Debug impl be redacted? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Test-Only Code] The code has #[cfg(test)] and #[cfg(any(test, feature = \\",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Dependency Versions] The code uses curve25519_dalek, ed25519_dalek, and sha2 crates - are these dependencies pinned to specific versions, and could version changes introduce consensus-breaking changes to VRF behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Scalar Arithmetic] All scalar operations use references (&k_scalar, &c_scalar, etc.) - is this to ensure constant-time arithmetic, and could dereferencing cause variable-time operations on certain platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Point Arithmetic] All point operations use references (&H_point, &ED25519_BASEPOINT_POINT, etc.) - does this ensure constant-time operations, and could timing attacks extract bits of scalars through multiplication timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [VRF Leader Election] Since VRF proofs determine leader election in Stacks PoX, could an attacker who finds a way to forge VRF proofs control block production and reorganize the chain arbitrarily? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [VRF Uniqueness] Does the VRF implementation guarantee that for a given (private_key, alpha) pair, only one valid proof exists, preventing miners from grinding multiple proofs to improve sortition odds? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Deterministic Randomness] Does the VRF output derived from a proof provide uniform randomness for sortition, and could biased VRF outputs allow miners to predict or manipulate leader election? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Proof Malleability] Could an attacker take a valid VRF proof and modify it to create a different proof that still verifies, enabling transaction malleability-style attacks on VRF-based leader election? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Cross-Platform Consensus] Are all VRF operations (prove, verify, hash_to_curve) guaranteed to produce identical results on different platforms (x86, ARM, etc.) and operating systems, preventing consensus splits? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [VRF Validation DoS] Could an attacker flood the network with invalid VRF proofs that are expensive to verify (e.g., requiring many hash_to_curve iterations), causing DoS of block validation? (High)"
