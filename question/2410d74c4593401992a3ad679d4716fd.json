  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast_p2p()] [P2P Broadcast Fault Injection] fault_injection_broadcast_fail() can randomly drop blocks - but is this fault injection accidentally enabled in production? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [Chainstate Open Failure] If open_chainstate_with_faults() fails, a SigningCoordinatorFailure is returned - but can repeated failures cause the miner to exit the mining loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [Late Block Tenure Exit] If last_block_mined.is_some() && reason.is_late_block(), the function exits with StacksTipChanged - but can this exit prematurely if the block hasn't been fully processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [Mock Mining Parent Wait] In mock mining, if the parent isn't processed, the function sleeps and returns Ok(()) - but can this cause infinite waiting if the parent is never processed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [Mempool Cache Reset] reset_mempool_caches is checked multiple times with different conditions - can inconsistent reset logic cause mempool state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [NextNonceWithHighestFeeRate Strategy] This strategy always resets the considered_txs cache - but can this cause the same transactions to be repeatedly considered and rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: attempt_mine_and_propose_block()] [Wait for Block Processed] wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed() blocks the miner - but can this cause the miner to miss burn tip changes or tenure extend opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [Timestamp Validation Retry] If validate_timestamp() returns false, Ok(None) is returned to retry - but can rapid retries cause resource exhaustion without backing off? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [MinerAborted Distinction] MinerAborted can come from abort_flag or other causes - but does the error handling properly distinguish between intentional shutdown and mining failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [Empty Mempool Sleep] When NoTransactionsToMine occurs, the miner sleeps for empty_mempool_sleep_time - but can this sleep duration be too short, causing busy-waiting? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [Abort Flag Check During Sleep] During empty_mempool_sleep_time, abort_flag is checked every ABORT_TRY_AGAIN_MS - but can frequent checks cause CPU spinning? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [SortitionDB Open Failure] If SortitionDB::open() fails during empty mempool wait, Ok(None) is returned - but should this be a fatal error instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block_and_handle_result()] [ParentNotFound in Mock Mining] ParentNotFound is treated specially for mock_mining - but can this allow mock mining to continue with invalid parents? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [StacksTipChanged Handling] When propose_block() returns StacksTipChanged, Ok(false) is returned to retry - but can rapid tip changes cause the miner to never successfully mine a block? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [BurnchainTipChanged Propagation] BurnchainTipChanged returns Err(e), exiting the mining loop - but is this exit coordinated with other miner state cleanup? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [BadSigner Error Handling] StackerDBUploadError with BadSigner code is treated as unrecoverable - but can transient signer issues be misclassified as BadSigner? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Pause and Retry Logic] pause_and_retry() uses first_rejection_pause_ms or subsequent_rejection_pause_ms - but can excessive pauses cause the miner to miss sortitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Last Block Rejected Flag] last_block_rejected is set to false on success but true on retry - can this flag persist across tenure boundaries, affecting unrelated proposals? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Signer Signature Assignment] new_block.header.signer_signature = signer_signature mutates the block - but is the miner signature still valid after this mutation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Broadcast Failure] If broadcast() returns Err, Ok(false) is returned to retry - but does this correctly clean up the proposed block from coordinator state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Mempool Cache Reset] reset_mempool_caches is set to false after successful broadcast - but can this cause stale mempool state if the block is later rejected by the network? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [Naka Mined Blocks Counter] globals.counters.bump_naka_mined_blocks() is called before confirmation - but can this overcount if the block is later rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_new_block_and_broadcast()] [First Block Tenure Counter] If last_block_mined.is_none(), bump_naka_mined_tenures() is called - but can this fail to increment for extended tenures? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Mock Mining Skip] In mock_mining, the function sleeps for min_time_between_blocks_ms - but does this properly simulate network propagation delays? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: wait_for_last_block_mined_and_processed()] [Processed Flag Query] get_block_processed_and_signed_weight() is called to check if the block is processed - but can this query fail transiently, causing incorrect waits? (Medium)"
