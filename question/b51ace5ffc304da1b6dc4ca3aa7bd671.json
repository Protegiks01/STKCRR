  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: start()] [Genesis State Timestamp] Does start() use Instant::now() for the genesis BurnchainTip's received_at field, and can clock skew or time manipulation affect consensus? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: get_stacks_epochs()] [Execution Cost Max Value] Does get_stacks_epochs() set block_limit to ExecutionCost::max_value() for all epochs (lines 110, 117, 124), completely disabling cost accounting and allowing infinite execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: get_stacks_epochs()] [Epoch Transition Heights] Are the hardcoded epoch transition heights (start_height: 0, 1, 2) in get_stacks_epochs() appropriate for mocknet, or can they cause issues when syncing with different configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: get_stacks_epochs()] [Epoch End Height] Does the Epoch21 end_height of STACKS_EPOCH_MAX at line 123 correctly represent an unbounded epoch, or can overflow occur? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: get_stacks_epochs()] [Network Epoch Versions] Are the network_epoch values (PEER_VERSION_EPOCH_2_0, 2_05, 2_1) correctly mapped to their corresponding epoch IDs, and can version mismatches cause peer rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: new()] [Uninitialized Database] Does new() leave db as None, requiring start() to be called, and can other methods be invoked before initialization causing panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: new()] [Empty Operation Queue] Does new() initialize queued_operations as an empty VecDeque, and is there any bound or capacity limit set to prevent unbounded growth? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: new()] [Burnchain Config] Does new() call config.get_burnchain() without validating the returned Burnchain configuration, potentially accepting invalid or malicious burnchain parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Txid Collision] Does submit_operation() call operation.txid() at line 171 without checking for collisions in queued_operations, allowing duplicate txids to be processed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Txid Determinism] Are txids generated deterministically from operation content, and can an attacker create different operations with identical txids causing confusion in transaction tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [State Transition Extraction] Does sync() extract only accepted_ops and consumed_leader_keys from the state_transition at lines 293-296, discarding other important state data that should be preserved? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Received At Timestamp] Does sync() set received_at to Instant::now() at line 302 for every new BurnchainTip, and can this create timestamp inconsistencies if processing is delayed? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Block Height Return] Does sync() return both BurnchainTip and block_height at lines 306-307, and is this redundant data that could get out of sync? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Process Block Ops False Parameter] What does the 'false' parameter on line 276 passed to process_block_ops() control, and can changing this to true alter consensus behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Process Block Ops None Parameters] Does passing None for the block header parameter (line 281) and aggregate public key parameter (line 283) at process_block_ops() disable important validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Process Block Ops Zero Param] What does the '0' parameter on line 284 passed to process_block_ops() represent, and can a non-zero value change sortition outcomes? (Medium)"
