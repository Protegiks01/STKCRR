(Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/mod.rs] [Function: increment_msg_counter()] [Resource Exhaustion] At lines 337-339, can an attacker send messages with unique names to create unbounded MSG_COUNTER_VEC entries, exhausting memory with metric labels? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/monitoring/mod.rs] [Function: update_computed_miner_commitment()] [Value Interpretation] At lines 422-426, when a u128 commitment value is split into high and low i64 parts with potential negative values due to casting, can monitoring tools misinterpret the commitment amount? (Low)",
