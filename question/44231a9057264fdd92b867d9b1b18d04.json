  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Tests: block_test] [Incomplete Merkle Root Validation] The test comment says 'TODO: actually compute the merkle root'—does this mean merkle root validation is untested and potentially buggy in production? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Tests: block_test] [Transaction Data Validation] The test comment says 'TODO: check the transaction data'—are transactions not validated during block parsing, allowing malformed transaction data to pass? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Tests: segwit_block_test] [SegWit Handling] The test handles version 0x20000000 (VERSIONBITS)—can nodes that don't properly implement VERSIONBITS validation accept invalid blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Tests: compact_roundtrip_test] [Roundtrip Consistency] The test validates that `compact_target_from_u256(&header.target())` equals `header.bits`—can non-canonical compact encodings cause nodes to disagree on whether a block meets target? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Cross-Function: target() and spv_validate()] [Inconsistent Target Calculation] If `target()` is called multiple times during validation with different results (due to bugs), can this cause acceptance of blocks that should be rejected? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Cross-Function: compact_target_to_u256() and compact_target_from_u256()] [Roundtrip Failure] Can certain Uint256 values fail to roundtrip correctly through the compact encoding/decoding, causing consensus nodes to disagree on block target? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Cross-Function: work() and difficulty()] [Work vs Difficulty Inconsistency] Can blocks have valid difficulty but incorrect work values, or vice versa, causing chain selection to prefer the wrong fork? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Cross-Function: bitcoin_hash() for Block vs BlockHeader] [Hash Consistency] Since Block's hash delegates to BlockHeader's hash, can modifications to txdata after block construction cause the block hash to not reflect the actual block content? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Integration: Burnchain Validation] [Bitcoin Block Acceptance] Does this code validate that Bitcoin blocks meet Bitcoin consensus rules, or can invalid Bitcoin blocks be accepted as valid burnchain anchors? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Integration: SPV Validation] [SPV Security Model] The `spv_validate()` function only checks proof-of-work—can an attacker create Bitcoin blocks with valid PoW but invalid transaction data that the Stacks chain accepts? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Integration: Target Adjustment] [Difficulty Adjustment Logic] This file doesn't implement Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm—can nodes accept Bitcoin blocks with incorrect difficulty targets during retarget periods? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Integration: Block Relay] [Malformed Block Propagation] Can malformed blocks that pass deserialization but fail validation be relayed to peers, causing network-wide DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Performance: Serialization] [Repeated Serialization] The `bitcoin_hash()` function serializes the header on every call—can repeated hashing of the same block cause performance degradation or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Memory: Large Blocks] [Memory Exhaustion] Can extremely large blocks (with txdata containing millions of transactions) cause memory exhaustion during deserialization? (High)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Type Safety: Sha256dHash] [Hash Type Confusion] Can `Sha256dHash` values be confused with other hash types, causing blocks to reference the wrong previous block or merkle root? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Type Safety: PartialEq] [Equality Comparison] The structs derive PartialEq—can floating-point-like comparison issues in the bits field cause blocks to be considered equal when they have different targets? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Type Safety: Public Fields] [Field Mutation] All struct fields are public—can external code mutate fields after construction, creating blocks with inconsistent state (e.g., header.bits doesn't match actual PoW)? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Crypto: SHA256 Implementation] [Hash Function Security] Does the `Sha256dHash::from_data()` implementation use a cryptographically secure SHA256, or can weaknesses allow collision or preimage attacks? (Critical)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Crypto: Nonce Space] [Limited Nonce Space] The nonce is only 32 bits—can modern mining hardware exhaust the nonce space and force miners to manipulate other fields (timestamp, coinbase), enabling attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/blockdata/block.rs] [Edge Case: Zero Values] [All-Zero Block] Can a block with all fields set to zero (version=0, prev_blockhash=0, etc.) be successfully parsed and validated, causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
