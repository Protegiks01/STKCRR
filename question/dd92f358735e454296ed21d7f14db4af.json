  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: parse_postblock_octets()] [Buffer Not Fully Consumed] At line 52, the function takes `mut body: &[u8]`, and line 53 deserializes from it - if deserialization doesn't consume all bytes, is there a check to ensure no trailing data remains?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consensus Hash Binding] Does the block validation ensure the consensus_hash in the block header correctly binds to a Bitcoin burnchain block via sortition, or can attackers use arbitrary consensus hashes?
