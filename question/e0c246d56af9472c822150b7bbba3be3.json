  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Handling] Can the Error::Io variant wrap arbitrary io::Error instances that might leak sensitive information about internal file paths, network configurations, or system state when propagated to external callers or logged? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Information Disclosure] Does the Display implementation for Error::Io forward the underlying io::Error's Display output without sanitization, potentially exposing internal system details or network topology information to untrusted parties? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Function: Error::cause()] [Error Propagation] Can the cause() method expose the underlying io::Error chain in a way that reveals implementation details about socket handling, file operations, or network state that could aid in reconnaissance attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Missing Variants] Does the Error enum lack variants for critical network-level security errors such as certificate validation failures, protocol version mismatches, or message authentication failures that could lead to silent acceptance of malicious data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error::SocketMutexPoisoned] [Concurrency Safety] If a mutex is poisoned due to a panic while holding it, does the error handling in consuming code properly abort processing to prevent operating on inconsistent network state that could lead to consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error::SocketNotConnectedToPeer] [State Management] Can the SocketNotConnectedToPeer error be triggered in a way that causes inconsistent state between what the node believes about peer connections and the actual network state, potentially allowing message replay or routing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Module Structure] [Dependency Management] Do the imported submodules (address, constants, encodable, serialize, message, message_blockdata, message_network) have proper visibility controls to prevent internal implementation details from being exposed that could be exploited in network protocol attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Context Loss] Does the Error enum's minimal structure cause loss of critical context about network errors (such as which peer, which message type, or which validation step failed) that would be needed for proper security incident analysis or debugging consensus issues? (Low)"
