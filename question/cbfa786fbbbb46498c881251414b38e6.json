  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/inv/mod.rs] [Re-export: INV_REWARD_CYCLES, INV_SYNC_INTERVAL] [Consensus Divergence] Could the re-export of INV_REWARD_CYCLES and INV_SYNC_INTERVAL from inv2x create a situation where different parts of the codebase use different values for these constants if epoch2x and nakamoto define conflicting values, leading to consensus divergence between nodes processing different inventory types? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/inv/mod.rs] [Module Alias: inv2x] [API Confusion] Does the aliasing of 'epoch2x as inv2x' create ambiguity for consumers that might accidentally use epoch2x-specific logic when nakamoto inventory handling is required, potentially causing inventory sync failures or allowing invalid block propagation during epoch transitions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/inv/mod.rs] [Re-export Pattern] [Visibility Control] Could the public re-export of inv2x constants without explicit validation or bounds checking allow external modules to access inventory sync parameters that should be restricted to specific epoch contexts, enabling DoS attacks by forcing inventory synchronization at inappropriate intervals? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/inv/mod.rs] [Module Structure] [Namespace Collision] If both epoch2x and nakamoto submodules define types or functions with identical names, could the lack of explicit namespacing in the parent module lead to compilation ambiguity or runtime confusion where the wrong inventory implementation is invoked? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/inv/mod.rs] [Constant Re-export] [Configuration Consistency] Does re-exporting INV_REWARD_CYCLES without validation ensure that the constant value matches the actual reward cycle length enforced by the PoX consensus rules, or could a mismatch cause inventory sync to miss critical PoX anchor blocks? (Critical)"
