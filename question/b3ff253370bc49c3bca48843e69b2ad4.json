  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [StacksBlockId Chain Indexing] For StacksBlockId at line 64, which indexes blocks in the MARF, could deserialization errors cause blocks to be indexed under incorrect IDs, corrupting the block tree structure? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [hex_bytes Error Propagation] Does the hex_bytes() call in the macro properly propagate all error types (BadLength, BadCharacter) as FromSqlError::InvalidType, or could some errors be silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [from_bytes None Handling] When from_bytes() returns None due to length mismatch, does the macro properly convert this to FromSqlError::InvalidType, or could None propagate as a different error type? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [to_hex Consistency] Does the to_hex() method used in ToSql always produce lowercase hex output for all types, ensuring database queries with hex literals work consistently? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [SQL Injection] Can any of the ToSql implementations at lines 38-50 and generated by the macro produce output containing SQL special characters (quotes, semicolons) that could be exploited if the serialized values are used in dynamic SQL? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Database Type Mismatch] If a database column declared as TEXT contains binary data or an INTEGER, do the FromSql implementations properly reject the type mismatch, or could they attempt to interpret integers/blobs as hex strings? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Unicode Handling] Can the hex string deserialization at line 32 and in the macro handle multi-byte UTF-8 characters properly, or could unicode characters that look like hex digits (e.g., full-width 'Ａ') be misinterpreted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Null Value Handling] Do all FromSql implementations properly reject SQL NULL values, or could NULL be deserialized as a zero-filled hash/address, potentially matching a legitimate all-zeros value? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Roundtrip Consistency] For each type, is it guaranteed that deserializing a serialized value produces the exact same bytes, or could lossy encoding (e.g., case normalization, zero-stripping) cause roundtrip failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Empty String Handling] Can an empty string '' in the database be deserialized by any of the FromSql implementations, or is it properly rejected as invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Prefix Handling] Do the hex deserialization functions reject strings with '0x' prefixes, or could '0x' + valid hex be accepted, causing the deserialized value to include the prefix characters? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Lines 54-64] [Type Confusion] Since ConsensusHash, BlockHeaderHash, TrieHash, and other types all serialize to hex strings, could database corruption or query errors cause a ConsensusHash to be deserialized as a BlockHeaderHash (or vice versa), violating type safety? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Lines 54-64] [Length Collision] If multiple types have the same byte length (e.g., all 32-byte hashes), does the database schema enforce type safety, or could a database migration or manual edit cause one hash type to be substituted for another? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro Usage] [VRFProof Size] VRFProof at line 59 has a specific size requirement - does from_bytes() enforce the exact expected length, or could variable-length proofs be stored? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro Usage] [MessageSignature Components] MessageSignature at line 62 contains r, s, v components - does deserialization validate these are in canonical form, or could high-s signatures or invalid recovery IDs be stored? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Function: Sha256dHash::column_result()] [DoS via Large Strings] If an attacker populates the database with extremely long strings (megabytes) in hash columns, does from_hex() at line 33 immediately reject them based on length, or attempt to process them causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [hex_bytes Allocation] When hex_bytes() is called in the macro, does it allocate memory proportional to the input string length, allowing an attacker to cause excessive allocations with very long database strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Database Query Performance] Do indexes on hash columns work efficiently with hex string storage, or could certain byte patterns (e.g., all zeros, all 'f's) cause index performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Partial Writes] If a database write transaction is interrupted, could partially-written hex strings be left in the database that fail to deserialize on the next read, causing database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Encoding Mismatch] If the database connection uses a different character encoding (e.g., UTF-16, Latin-1) than expected, could hex strings be corrupted during storage/retrieval? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Collation Issues] Do hex string comparisons in SQL queries respect case-insensitivity properly, or could 'ABC' and 'abc' be treated as different values in WHERE clauses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Format Migration] If a future protocol upgrade changes the serialization format (e.g., base64 instead of hex), can old database values still be read, or would migration be required? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Function: StacksAddress::to_sql()] [Address Version Upgrade] If the StacksAddress version byte changes in a hard fork, can old C32-encoded addresses in the database still be properly interpreted? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Function: Sha256dHash::column_result()] [Timing Attack] Does from_hex() comparison at line 33 execute in constant time, or could timing differences leak information about hash values stored in the database? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Lines 54-64] [Zero Hash Acceptance] For consensus-critical hashes like ConsensusHash and BlockHeaderHash, does deserialization reject all-zero values that should never occur naturally, or could '000...000' be stored and accepted? (High)"
