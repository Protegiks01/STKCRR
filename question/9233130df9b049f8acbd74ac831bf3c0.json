  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker provide a cycle_num string that parses successfully as u64 but causes integer overflow when used in reward_cycle_to_block_height() calculation, potentially accessing incorrect reward sets or causing panic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Does the regex pattern ^/v3/stacker_set/(?P<cycle_num>[0-9]{1,10})$ properly prevent leading zeros in cycle numbers (e.g., '0000000001') which could cause inconsistent cycle number interpretation across different parsing contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker bypass the 10-digit limit in the regex by providing a number like '9999999999' that fits the pattern but represents an unrealistically high cycle number, potentially causing expensive database queries or accessing uninitialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [DoS] Does the u64::from_str_radix call on line 140 properly handle all edge cases of valid decimal strings, or can specially crafted input cause excessive parsing time or resource consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] If preamble.get_content_length() returns a non-zero value on line 129, the request is rejected - but can an attacker manipulate the Content-Length header to bypass other validation while still passing this check? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Authorization] The check on line 90 only allows PoX-4, but can an attacker query cycle numbers from epochs before PoX-4 activation and receive an error that leaks information about when PoX-4 was activated or reward set structure? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Consensus Divergence] If PoxVersions::lookup_by_name() returns None on line 88-89, an 'Other' error is returned - but can this mask a more serious consensus failure where the PoX contract name is invalid or corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [State Consistency] The cycle_start_height is calculated on line 84 using reward_cycle_to_block_height() - can an attacker provide a cycle_number that causes this calculation to return a height beyond the current tip, allowing access to uninitialized or speculative reward sets? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [PoX Reward Theft] Does the check for PoX-4 on line 90 guarantee that the reward set returned contains valid signer keys and weights, or could a race condition during PoX version transition allow retrieval of malformed reward sets? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Information Disclosure] The error message on lines 92-93 reveals that 'Pre-PoX-4' contracts don't support signer sets - can an attacker use this to infer internal PoX transition state or determine if the node is syncing through historical epochs? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [DoS] The read_reward_set_nakamoto() call on line 99 with 'true' parameter may perform expensive database queries - can an attacker flood the endpoint with requests for different cycle numbers to exhaust database resources or cause lock contention? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [State Consistency] The reward set is read with the 'true' flag on line 99, indicating it should read from Nakamoto - but what happens if the tip provided is from a pre-Nakamoto epoch, could this cause state inconsistency or incorrect reward set retrieval? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Race Condition] The function takes a mutable reference to chainstate on line 79 and calls read_reward_set_nakamoto() - can concurrent requests cause race conditions where one request's chainstate modifications affect another's reward set calculation?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: GetStackersResponse::load()] [Consensus Divergence] Does OnChainRewardSetProvider::new() on line 97 guarantee deterministic behavior across all nodes, or could different provider instances return different reward sets for the same cycle_number at the same tip?

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Inconsistency] If load_stacks_chain_tip() succeeds but returns a stale tip that's not on the canonical chain, will the subsequent reward set query on lines 177-186 use outdated state that conflicts with current consensus?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] When load_stacks_chain_tip() fails on line 164-165, the error_resp is converted to contents and returned - does this error leak internal state about tip selection, reorg status, or node synchronization progress? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [DoS] Can an attacker provide a specially crafted TipRequest in the query parameters that causes load_stacks_chain_tip() to perform expensive database lookups or traverse deep chain history? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackers.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] The error message on line 70 includes 'Err = {e:?}' with debug formatting - can this expose internal database paths, memory addresses, or other sensitive implementation details when NotAvailableYet is returned?
