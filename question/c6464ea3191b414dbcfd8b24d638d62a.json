  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Input Validation Bypass] Can an attacker submit operations with invalid or malformed fields (e.g., zero block heights, invalid consensus hashes, malformed public keys) since submit_operation() performs no validation before queuing, potentially causing consensus divergence when sync() processes these operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Replay Attack] Can an attacker submit the same BlockstackOperationType multiple times with identical txids, since there is no duplicate detection in submit_operation() or deduplication in the queued_operations VecDeque, potentially causing double-spending or duplicate leader key registrations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Signature Bypass] Does the fact that submit_operation() ignores the BurnchainOpSigner parameter and never verifies signatures mean that any attacker can submit operations on behalf of arbitrary addresses, bypassing authentication entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [DoS via Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker repeatedly call submit_operation() to fill the unbounded queued_operations VecDeque with millions of operations, exhausting memory and causing node crashes or performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Fee Bypass] Since submit_operation() does not validate burn_fee amounts in LeaderBlockCommit operations, can an attacker submit block commits with zero or negative fees, violating sortition economics and enabling free mining? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: submit_operation()] [Access Control] Does submit_operation() lack any access control checks, allowing any caller to submit consensus-critical operations (leader keys, block commits, stacking operations) without authorization? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: build_next_block_header()] [Hash Collision] Can the deterministic SHA256-based hash generation in build_next_block_header() (hashing only the previous block hash) lead to predictable or colliding block hashes if an attacker can manipulate the input burn_header_hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: build_next_block_header()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Does build_next_block_header() use get_epoch_time_secs() without validation, allowing timestamp manipulation if system time is incorrect, potentially violating block time ordering invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: build_next_block_header()] [Block Height Overflow] Can the block_height increment (current_block.block_height + 1) overflow if the chain reaches u64::MAX, causing wraparound to height 0 and catastrophic consensus failure? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: build_next_block_header()] [Parent Reference] Does build_next_block_header() properly validate that current_block is not null or corrupted before dereferencing burn_header_hash and block_height, or can this cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Operation Ordering] Does sync() process queued_operations in FIFO order via pop_front(), and can an attacker exploit this ordering by submitting operations in a sequence that violates consensus rules (e.g., LeaderBlockCommit before LeaderKeyRegister)? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [State Transition Validation] Does sync() call process_block_ops() without validating the returned state_transition, allowing invalid operations to be committed to the sortition database? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Atomic Commit Failure] If burn_tx.commit() fails after process_block_ops() succeeds, can this leave the sortition database in an inconsistent state where operations are partially applied? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [PoxId Stubbed] Does sync() pass PoxId::stubbed() to process_block_ops(), potentially bypassing PoX reward cycle validation and allowing invalid stacking operations to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Empty Operations Block] Can sync() create a new block with zero operations when queued_operations is empty, and does this violate any consensus rules about minimum block content or cause sortition failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Chain Tip Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to sync() cause race conditions when reading chain_tip at line 180 and updating it at line 304, leading to lost updates or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Process Block Ops Unwrap] Does sync() unwrap the result of process_block_ops() at line 286 without error handling, causing the node to panic if block processing fails for any reason? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [Commit Unwrap] Does sync() unwrap burn_tx.commit() at line 287 without handling potential database commit failures, causing panics and node crashes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderKeyRegister Validation] In the LeaderKeyRegister operation handling (lines 188-198), are the consensus_hash, public_key, and memo fields validated before being copied into the new operation, or can malformed keys cause consensus failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderKeyRegister Block Height] Does sync() correctly assign next_block_header.block_height to LeaderKeyRegister operations, and can an attacker exploit timing to register keys at unexpected heights? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderKeyRegister Memo] Are the memo fields in LeaderKeyRegister operations validated for size limits or malicious content, or can an attacker inject arbitrary data that bloats the sortition database? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderBlockCommit Parent Validation] In the LeaderBlockCommit handling (lines 199-223), does sync() validate parent_block_ptr and parent_vtxindex to ensure they reference valid previous blocks, or can an attacker create orphaned commits? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderBlockCommit Key Reference] Does sync() validate that key_block_ptr and key_vtxindex in LeaderBlockCommit operations reference previously registered leader keys, or can commits reference non-existent keys? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderBlockCommit Burn Fee] Does the LeaderBlockCommit reconstruction preserve the burn_fee field without validation, allowing zero or excessive fees that violate sortition rules? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/burnchains/mocknet_controller.rs] [Function: sync()] [LeaderBlockCommit Modulus Calculation] Can the burn_parent_modulus calculation at lines 217-221 produce incorrect values when block_height is 0, since the code checks 'if next_block_header.block_height > 0' but still performs modulus on (block_height - 1)? (High)"
