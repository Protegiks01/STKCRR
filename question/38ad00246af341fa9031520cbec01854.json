  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Identical Burn Fees] If all miners have identical burn_fee values, does the sortition range distribution still work correctly, or can rounding cause some miners to get zero range? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Window Size Transition] When transitioning between different window sizes (e.g., entering/exiting prepare phase), can the linking logic handle commits that span the transition boundary? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Txid Format] Are txids validated for correct format, or can malformed txids cause HashMap issues or bypass UTXO chain validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Zero Frequency] Can a miner end up with frequency = 0 despite having a valid current commit, and if so, how does this affect their sortition chances? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Frequency Fairness] Does frequency affect only statistics, or is it used in sortition weighting, and if used, can miners game it by submit multiple chains? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Remove Timing] The sequential remove() operations at lines 200-201 modify vectors during iteration - can this cause skipped elements or processing errors? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Index Shift] After remove() at line 187, do subsequent indexes shift correctly, or can this cause off-by-one errors in the remaining iterations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Candidate Extraction] The candidate is extracted by removing from linked_commits[0] at line 302, but can this fail if the first entry is None? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Field Assignment] Are all BurnSamplePoint fields initialized correctly at lines 317-324, or can some remain at default/zero values? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Missed Commit Count] Can the ratio of missed to valid commits in a window be exploited to manipulate medians, since missed commits contribute burn_fee=1? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Missed Commit Chaining] Can missed commits chain to other missed commits, creating long chains of 1-sat burns that dilute the median? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Missed vs Valid Precedence] Valid commits are checked before missed commits (lines 230-237), but is this precedence documented and can it be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_sortition_ranges()] [Zero Burn Handling] If a miner has burns=0 in their BurnSamplePoint, do they get zero range width, and if so, can they ever win sortition? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_sortition_ranges()] [Range Ordering] Are ranges guaranteed to be in the same order as burn_sample, or can the calculation reorder them? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_sortition_ranges()] [Accumulator Precision] Does burn_acc maintain sufficient precision throughout iteration to ensure accurate range_end calculations for all samples? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: sanity_check_window()] [Block Height Consistency] The assertion at lines 122-125 checks block height ordering, but can reorgs or chain revalidation cause this to be violated transiently? (High)"
