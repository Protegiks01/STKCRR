  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consensus Critical] If a tenure has multiple valid blocks at the same height due to a temporary fork, does find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() deterministically select one, or could different nodes return different 'highest' blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Validation] Is the consensus_hash parameter validated to correspond to an actual Bitcoin block/sortition before querying chainstate, or could an attacker provide a valid-format but non-existent consensus_hash to trigger database scans? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Race Condition] Between the time find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() is called at line 102 and the response is serialized at line 139, could a new block arrive that changes the tenure tip, causing stale data to be returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Chainstate Consistency] Does the with_node_state() call at line 100 hold locks on sortdb and chainstate for the entire query duration, and could this cause deadlocks if other operations are waiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Byzantine Behavior] If a Byzantine node intentionally returns a fabricated tenure_tip with mismatched anchored_header and burn_view, could clients be misled about chain state without detecting the inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Semantics] Does 'highest block in tenure' account for Nakamoto tenure rules where a tenure can span multiple Bitcoin blocks, or could this query return incorrect results during tenure transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Fork Choice] If there are competing blocks at the same height in a tenure (e.g., due to a chain reorg), does the 'highest' selection follow the canonical fork choice rule, or could this expose an inconsistent view? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Handling] When returning HttpNotFound at lines 111-114, is the error propagated correctly through the NetError conversion at line 134, or could error mapping lose important context? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Handling] When returning HttpServerError at lines 122-125, the error includes the raw error from find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure(). Could this leak internal database paths, SQL queries, or other sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Panic] If tenure_tip_resp is Err(response) at line 133, does the try_into_contents() call at line 134 handle all possible response types, or could unexpected response structures cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Type Safety] The preamble variable is shadowed at line 138, creating a new HttpResponsePreamble. Could confusion between the request and response preambles cause incorrect header handling? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Error Propagation] The ? operator at line 156 converts parse_json errors into the outer Result type. Are all possible JSON parsing errors correctly mapped to appropriate Error variants? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Type Mismatch] If the response body contains valid JSON but with unexpected field types (e.g., burn_view as a string instead of an Option), does parse_json() fail gracefully or could it cause panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Concurrency] The with_node_state() closure at line 100 accesses network, sortdb, chainstate, mempool, and rpc_args. Are these resources properly locked to prevent concurrent modifications during the query? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Race Condition] If chainstate is modified between the find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() call and the response serialization, could the anchored_header reference stale or invalidated data? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Struct: NakamotoTenureTipMetadataRequestHandler] [Thread Safety] The handler is marked Clone at line 28, allowing multiple instances. If the same handler instance is reused across concurrent requests without restart(), could consensus_hash state be corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Locking] Does the with_node_state() call hold read or write locks on sortdb/chainstate, and could long-running queries block consensus-critical operations like block validation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Struct: BlockHeaderWithMetadata] [Invariant] Should the burn_view field at line 36 always be Some when anchored_header is present, or are there legitimate cases where burn_view is None, and could this indicate chainstate corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Data Validation] Are the anchored_header and burn_view fields from tenure_tip (lines 140-141) validated to match the requested consensus_hash before being returned, or could mismatched data be propagated? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tenure Consistency] If the tenure identified by consensus_hash has not yet been finalized or confirmed, could find_highest_known_block_header_in_tenure() return a block that is later orphaned, causing clients to build on an invalid chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Struct: BlockHeaderWithMetadata] [Serialization Determinism] Is the JSON serialization of BlockHeaderWithMetadata deterministic (field order, number encoding), or could different serializations of the same data cause hash mismatches in downstream processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Burn View Semantics] What does burn_view represent (Bitcoin block consensus hash?), and could an attacker provide a consensus_hash that maps to a fork or reorged Bitcoin block, causing incorrect burn_view to be returned? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Path: /v3/tenures/tip_metadata/] [API Versioning] The endpoint is versioned as /v3/, but does the handler validate the client's protocol version, or could v2 clients make incompatible requests that return data in an unexpected format? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Struct: StacksBlockHeaderTypes] [Type Evolution] If StacksBlockHeaderTypes enum gains new variants in future protocol upgrades, could older clients fail to deserialize responses from upgraded nodes, causing network partitioning? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenure_tip_meta.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Backward Compatibility] If the regex pattern at line 54 is modified to accept additional consensus hash formats, could this create ambiguity with older clients expecting exactly 40 hex characters? (Medium)"
