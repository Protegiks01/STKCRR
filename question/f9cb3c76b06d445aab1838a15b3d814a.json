  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: contract_id_consensus_deserialize()] [Address Construction] If StacksAddress::new() at lines 796-801 fails, the error message is generic - could this hide attacks that try invalid version/hash combinations to probe network behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBHandshakeData::consensus_serialize()] [Array Length Limit] At lines 810-812, if smart_contracts.len() > 256, it returns ArrayTooLong, but does this check occur before or after other validations, and could it be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBHandshakeData::consensus_serialize()] [Panic on Overflow] At line 814, try_into().expect() will panic if len > 256, but this was already checked - is this defensive check redundant, or could it hide a logic error? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBHandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Loop Bound] At lines 827-830, the loop iterates len_u8 times, but if len_u8 is 255 and deserialization fails partway, could this leave partially initialized smart_contracts vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBHandshakeData::consensus_deserialize()] [Duplicate Contracts] Does deserialization check for duplicate QualifiedContractIdentifier entries, or could an attacker send the same contract ID multiple times causing redundant processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBGetChunkInvData::consensus_deserialize()] [Contract ID Validation] The contract_id is deserialized but not validated for existence - could an attacker query non-existent contracts causing expensive lookups? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBChunkInvData::consensus_deserialize()] [Version Overflow] The slot_versions are Vec<u32>, but if an attacker sends maximum u32 values for all slots, could this cause overflow in version comparison logic downstream? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBChunkInvData::consensus_deserialize()] [Replica Count] The num_outbound_replicas is read but not validated - could 0 or excessively large values cause replication failures or DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBGetChunkData::consensus_deserialize()] [Slot ID Validation] The slot_id is read but not validated against contract's max slots - could requesting slot_id = u32::MAX cause expensive lookups or panics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBGetChunkData::consensus_deserialize()] [Version Mismatch] If slot_version doesn't match the actual chunk version, does downstream code handle this gracefully, or could version confusion cause data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBPushChunkData::consensus_deserialize()] [Chunk Data Validation] The chunk_data is deserialized but not validated for signature correctness here - could an attacker push chunks with invalid signatures that are only caught later, wasting resources? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StackerDBPushChunkData::consensus_deserialize()] [Contract Authorization] Does deserialization check if the sender is authorized to push to this contract_id, or is that checked elsewhere allowing unauthorized push attempts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: RelayData::consensus_deserialize()] [Sequence Number] The seq field is read but not validated - could an attacker send seq = 0 or u32::MAX causing sequence tracking issues? (Low)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StacksMessageID::consensus_deserialize()] [Unknown ID Handling] At lines 1172-1176, unknown message IDs cause DeserializeError, but could an attacker send slightly invalid IDs to fingerprint node version or trigger error handling code paths?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/codec.rs] [Function: StacksMessageType::consensus_deserialize()] [Type Confusion] Could an attacker craft a message where the StacksMessageID indicates one type but the payload bytes match another type's format, causing type confusion during processing?
