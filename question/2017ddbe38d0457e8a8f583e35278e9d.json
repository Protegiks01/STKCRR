  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Edge Case] Can a line with exactly the maximum allowed length cause buffer issues or performance degradation in the BufReader? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Thread Safety] The ASEntry4 struct derives Clone but not Sync. If multiple threads access the same ASN vector, can this cause data races or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Concurrency] If multiple threads call from_file() simultaneously with the same file, can concurrent file access cause corruption or inconsistent results? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Parsing Logic] The function returns Ok(None) for whitespace/comments, but what if a line is partially valid (e.g., starts with whitespace but has content)? Can this cause silent skipping of malformed entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Numeric Parsing] The parse::<u8>() and parse::<u32>() calls don't specify overflow behavior. Can values like '256' for an octet or '4294967296' for ASN cause panics or wrapping on some platforms? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [String Processing] The split('.') operation on line 157 doesn't handle consecutive dots (e.g., '1..2.3.4'). Can this create empty string slices that fail parsing in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Loop Termination] The loop on line 57 relies on PermanentlyDrained for termination. If this error is never returned (e.g., on a non-blocking socket), can the loop hang forever? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Attack Vector] Can an attacker who controls the ASN file path inject malicious ASN mappings to reroute peer connections, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks on the P2P network? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Attack Vector] Can an attacker provide a file that maps legitimate ASNs to attacker-controlled ones, causing the node to incorrectly trust or distrust certain peers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Attack Vector] Can an attacker craft overlapping prefix entries with different masks to create ambiguous ASN lookups that behave differently across nodes, causing peer selection inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Standards Compliance] The mask restriction to 8-24 excludes /32 host routes and larger aggregates. Is this intentional, or can this cause legitimate ASN entries to be rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Standards Compliance] Real-world ASN databases include IPv6 entries. Does the absence of IPv6 support cause security issues where IPv6 peers are misclassified or rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Standards Compliance] Are reserved or special-use IP address ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.0/8, 0.0.0.0/8) allowed in the ASN file, and can this cause security issues? (Medium)"
