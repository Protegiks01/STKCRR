  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Propagation] If with_clarity_db_readonly() returns None anywhere in the chain (lines 138-205), does the outer code correctly distinguish between 'account not found' vs. 'database error'? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [JSON Serialization] When HttpResponseContents::try_from_json() is called, can malformed AccountEntryResponse values (e.g., balance strings with invalid hex) cause serialization to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [PoX Logic] If get_v2_unlock_height() or get_v3_unlock_height() return errors and are converted to None, can this cause locked tokens to appear unlocked prematurely, allowing theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Off-by-One] In the unlock height calculations, are boundary conditions (burn_block_height == unlock_height) handled correctly to prevent early unlocking? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Version Migration] If an account has STXBalance in LockedPoxOne variant but v2_unlock_height is queried, can this cause incorrect unlock calculations during PoX version transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Unlock Height] Can the unlock_height value returned to clients be manipulated or become inconsistent if get_locked_balance_at_burn_block() uses different v1/v2/v3 unlock heights than shown? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Deserialization] Can malicious nodes send AccountEntryResponse with mismatched balance/locked values (e.g., locked > balance + locked) that pass JSON validation but violate invariants? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Integer Overflow] When parsing balance and locked hex strings, can extremely large values cause integer overflow when converted back to u128, leading to incorrect client-side balance tracking? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: decode_account_entry_response()] [Error Handling] If serde_json::from_value() fails during deserialization, does the generic 'Failed to load from JSON' error message hide important validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Proof Validation] Does the client-side parsing validate that balance_proof and nonce_proof are either both present or both absent, preventing inconsistent proof states? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: new_getaccount()] [Request Validation] Can the format! macro for path construction be exploited with principals containing special characters to inject additional path segments or query parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: new_getaccount()] [Error Handling] The expect() call assumes request construction is infallible - are there any edge cases with principal formatting that could cause this to panic? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: new_getaccount()] [Parameter Injection] Can the proof query parameter be manipulated to values other than '0' or '1', and if so, how does the server handle unexpected values? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: restart()] [State Cleanup] If restart() is not called between requests, can the handler retain stale account data from a previous request, causing cross-request information leakage? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Isolation] When account.take() is called, does this properly move ownership and prevent the account field from being accessed multiple times in error paths? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Key Collision] Could ClarityDatabase::make_key_for_account_balance() or make_key_for_account_nonce() generate colliding keys for different principals, allowing one account's data to leak to another? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Key Stability] Are the database keys for balance and nonce deterministic and stable across node restarts, or can key changes cause data to become inaccessible? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Atomicity] Are all database reads within the with_clarity_db_readonly() closure atomic, or can partial updates from concurrent transactions be visible? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Read Isolation] Can the clarity_tx read snapshot become stale if the chainstate is modified by another thread during the execution of the closure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [DoS] When with_proof is true, can proof generation for accounts with large balance history consume excessive CPU or memory, allowing DoS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Resource Limits] Is there a maximum depth or size limit for MARF proofs to prevent malicious accounts with intentionally deep state trees from causing resource exhaustion? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Format Consistency] Are the '0x' prefixed hex strings for balance and locked amounts always 32 bytes (including prefix), or can variable-length encoding cause parsing inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Proof Encoding] When balance_proof and nonce_proof are encoded with to_hex(), can malformed proof bytes cause invalid hex strings that break client parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tip Selection] When load_stacks_chain_tip() is called with request parameters, can an attacker specify an arbitrary past tip to query historical state and extract sensitive information? (Medium)"
