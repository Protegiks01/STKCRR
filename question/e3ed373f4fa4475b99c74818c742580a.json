  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/chat.rs] [Function: get_current_epoch()] [Epoch Panic] The unwrap_or_else with panic at line 733 can crash the node if block height is invalid. Can an attacker trigger this remotely? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/chat.rs] [Function: has_acceptable_epoch()] [Epoch Byte Extraction] The epoch extraction at lines 742-743 uses & 0x000000ff. Can an attacker exploit that higher bytes are ignored to send malformed versions? (Medium)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/chat.rs] [Function: handle_data_message()] [Message Type Exhaustive Matching] The match at lines 2272-2370 has a catch-all _ => return Ok(Some(msg)). Can an attacker send unknown message types that bypass all validation? (Medium)",
