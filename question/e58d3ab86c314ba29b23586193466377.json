  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: get_rate_estimates()] [Trait Implementation] The FeeEstimator trait method just calls get_rate_estimates_from_sql - could the trait hide important error context or make debugging harder? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: median()] [Empty Vector] The median function could receive an empty vector if all vectors (highs, mids, lows) are filtered out - is the check at line 122 sufficient? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_estimate_from_sorted_weighted_fees()] [Assert on Empty] The function asserts !sorted_fee_rates.is_empty() at line 237 - in production builds with assertions disabled, could this cause undefined behavior? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_estimate_from_sorted_weighted_fees()] [Assert on Weight] The function asserts total_weight > 0f64 at line 244 - if this fails in production, what is the fallback behavior? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_estimate_from_sorted_weighted_fees()] [Assert on Length] The function asserts percentiles.len() == sorted_fee_rates.len() at line 254 - could a logic bug cause these to differ? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: get_rate_estimates_from_sql()] [Prepared Statement] The SQL query uses prepared statements with params! - is this sufficient to prevent all SQL injection, or could malicious table names cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: update_estimate()] [Multiple SQL Operations] The function executes INSERT then DELETE - if the INSERT succeeds but DELETE fails, could this cause unbounded database growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_and_weight_from_receipt()] [NaN Handling] The function checks is_infinite() but not is_nan() - could NaN values propagate into fee estimates and cause corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_estimate_from_sorted_weighted_fees()] [Subnormal Numbers] Could very small weight or fee_rate values cause subnormal floating point numbers that behave unexpectedly in comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: median()] [Negative Values] The median function doesn't validate that fee rates are non-negative - could negative values in the database cause incorrect estimates? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_and_weight_from_receipt()] [Execution Cost Trust] The function trusts tx_receipt.execution_cost without validation - if upstream code provides inflated or deflated costs, could this corrupt fee estimates? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: fee_rate_and_weight_from_receipt()] [Transaction Fee Trust] The fee from tx.get_tx_fee() is trusted without bounds checking - could u64::MAX fees cause arithmetic issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/cost_estimates/fee_medians.rs] [Function: notify_block()] [Receipt Count] The function processes all receipts in receipt.tx_receipts - could an attacker include an excessive number of receipts to cause DoS? (Medium)"
