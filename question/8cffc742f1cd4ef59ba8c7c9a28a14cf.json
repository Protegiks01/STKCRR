(Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: new_get_stackerdb_metadata()] [Panic Safety] The expect() at line 155 assumes request construction is infallible. Are there any edge cases (e.g., extremely long contract names, Unicode issues) that could cause a panic and crash the node? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: new_get_stackerdb_metadata()] [Request Forgery] Can an attacker control the PeerHost parameter to redirect the request to a malicious endpoint while the URL path appears legitimate, potentially leaking sensitive metadata or triggering unintended behavior? (Medium)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Missing Access Control] Is there any authentication or authorization check before revealing StackerDB metadata at lines 101-112? Could unauthorized clients query sensitive contract metadata? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Metadata Privacy] Does exposing SlotMetadata through this public endpoint leak sensitive information about StackerDB state, slot ownership, or write patterns that could be exploited? (Medium)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Metadata Staleness] Is there any versioning or timestamp on the returned metadata to indicate its freshness? Could clients be misled by stale data during network partitions or high update rates? (Low)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbmetadata.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Metrics Confusion] The metrics identifier at line 57-59 uses placeholders. If multiple contract queries have different timings, could this hide DoS attacks or performance issues in monitoring? (Low)",
