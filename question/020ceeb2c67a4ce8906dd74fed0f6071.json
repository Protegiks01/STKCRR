  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker send a request with content-length 0 but non-empty body bytes to bypass the content-length check at line 174, potentially causing inconsistent parsing behavior between the HTTP layer and application layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [DoS] Can an attacker send requests with extremely large declared content-length values that pass the check at line 174 (expecting 0) to cause resource exhaustion or integer overflow in downstream HTTP processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Validation] Does the query string parsing at line 179 properly validate and sanitize query parameters, or can malformed query strings cause parsing errors or injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [DoS] Can the regex pattern at line 158 be exploited with catastrophic backtracking or ReDoS attacks if the path is maliciously crafted, causing CPU exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing the node's raw public key at line 111-112 via the API response allow attackers to link node identities across network restarts or configuration changes, violating privacy assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Information Disclosure] Can the public key hash derived at line 113 and exposed at line 135 be used to perform address grinding attacks or brute-force search for specific node identities? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Cryptographic] Does the public key derivation at line 111 using `from_private()` properly handle edge cases where the private key is zero, malformed, or outside the valid secp256k1 curve order? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus Divergence] Can exposing the `pox_consensus` hash at line 119 allow an attacker to determine if a node is on a minority fork and selectively target it for eclipse attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus Divergence] Does the `stable_pox_consensus` field at line 121 accurately reflect the consensus hash at the stable burn block height, or can there be a mismatch if the chainstate is in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Race Condition] Can concurrent modifications to `network.burnchain_tip.consensus_hash` at line 119 cause the returned `pox_consensus` to be inconsistent with other returned fields like `burn_block_height`? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Data Consistency] Can `burn_block_height` at line 120 be greater than `stable_burn_block_height` at line 122 by more than the expected stability window, indicating a potential consensus bug? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus Divergence] Can the `stacks_tip_height` at line 126 be inconsistent with the `stacks_tip` block hash at line 127 if there's a race condition during block processing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus Divergence] Does the `stacks_tip_consensus_hash` at line 128 always match the consensus hash that anchors the block referenced by `stacks_tip`, or can there be a mismatch during reorgs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Integer Overflow] Can `tenure_height` derived from `coinbase_height` at line 146 overflow if the coinbase height is at or near u64::MAX? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Race Condition] Can the unconfirmed state check at line 97-109 race with concurrent microblock processing, causing `num_mined_txs()` to return 0 when transactions actually exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus] Does the condition at line 99 checking `num_mined_txs() > 0` correctly handle the case where microblocks exist but have zero transactions, potentially exposing invalid unconfirmed tips? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Data Integrity] Can the `unconfirmed_chain_tip` cloned at line 101 reference a block that has been invalidated or orphaned since it was set in the unconfirmed state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Integer Overflow] Can `last_mblock_seq` at line 102 wrap around from u16::MAX to 0, causing sequence number confusion in microblock processing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getinfo.rs] [Function: from_network()] [Consensus] If `unconfirmed_state` is Some but `num_mined_txs() == 0` at line 99, should the unconfirmed_tip and sequence still be None, or does this hide valid microblock state? (Low)",
