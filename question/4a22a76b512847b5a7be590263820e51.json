  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Macro Import: #[macro_use] mod internal_macros] [Consensus Encoding Vulnerability] Does the #[macro_use] directive at line 35-36 expose consensus-critical encoding/decoding macros (impl_consensus_encoding, impl_newtype_consensus_encoding) throughout the bitcoin module without proper scoping, potentially allowing incorrect or non-deterministic serialization implementations in structs that should use different encoding rules? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Module Visibility: pub mod blockdata/network/util] [API Surface Exposure] Do the public module declarations at lines 38-40 expose internal Bitcoin primitives (transaction parsing, network message handling, hash utilities) that could be misused by other parts of the Stacks codebase to bypass consensus-critical validation when interacting with burnchain data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Compiler Lints: #![deny(unused_mut)]] [Code Quality] Does the deny(unused_mut) directive at line 32 prevent legitimate mutable references needed for consensus-critical operations in submodules, potentially forcing unsafe workarounds or incorrect borrowing patterns in Bitcoin transaction validation code? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Compiler Lints: #![deny(missing_docs)]] [Documentation Enforcement] Does the deny(missing_docs) directive at line 33 ensure that all public Bitcoin-related types and functions exposed by this module have documentation describing their consensus implications, or could undocumented public APIs lead to misuse in burnchain interaction code? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Module Structure] [Dependency Risk] Given that this module re-exports Bitcoin primitives derived from the Rust Bitcoin Library (as stated in lines 1-26), are there version compatibility or upgrade risks where changes to the underlying bitcoin crate could introduce consensus-breaking changes to how Stacks nodes parse Bitcoin blocks, transactions, or scripts? (Medium)"
