  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Struct: BurnSamplePoint] [Serialization] The BurnSamplePoint derives Serialize/Deserialize at line 28, but is the serialization deterministic across platforms and versions? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Float Precision] Although no floats are used, can any integer division operations produce different results on different architectures, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Vec Growth] The commits_with_priors Vec at line 184 grows with the number of miners, but is there a limit to prevent memory exhaustion from excessive block commits? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Clone Operations] Multiple clone() operations at lines 206, 211, 279 can be expensive, but can an attacker submit many commits to trigger excessive cloning and DoS validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_sortition_ranges()] [Iteration Cost] The iteration over burn_sample at line 388 has linear cost, but can this be exploited with very large sample sizes to slow down sortition? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Unwrap Safety] The unwrap() at line 220 assumes at least one non-None entry exists, but can this panic if all linked commits are None due to validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Expect Safety] Multiple expect() calls at lines 113, 295 assume infallibility, but can these be triggered in edge cases like invalid configuration or corrupted state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_sortition_ranges()] [First_mut Expect] The expect() at line 370 assumes non-empty burn_sample, but this was already checked at line 362, making the expect redundant or indicating a logic error? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Sort Stability] The sort() operation at line 280 on sorted_burns - is it stable across invocations with identical values, or can it affect consensus if burn amounts tie? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Min Comparison] The cmp::min() at line 289 compares u128 values, but can this produce different results if values are equal but have different representations? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Empty Block Commits] If block_commits is empty, the assertion at line 175 fails, but can upstream code incorrectly pass empty vectors during network partitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Window Mismatch] If mining_commitment_window parameter doesn't match the actual window size, can this cause assertion failures or logic errors? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Mutable State] The function takes mut block_commits and mut missed_commits, but can concurrent modifications during processing cause inconsistent results? (Medium)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/burn/distribution.rs] [Function: make_min_median_distribution()] [Chain Termination] If a UTXO chain terminates early (no parent found), the commit gets a burn of 1 at line 273, but can this be abused to keep costs low while maintaining presence? (Medium)",
