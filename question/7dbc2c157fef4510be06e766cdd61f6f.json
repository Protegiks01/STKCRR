  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Vote Reversal] Once a vote is cast and recorded in the votes map, can it be changed or reversed in any way? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Approval Reversal] Once an aggregate public key is approved and inserted into aggregate-public-keys map, can it ever be removed or changed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Tally Manipulation] After threshold is reached and key is approved, can subsequent votes still modify the tally map, potentially causing confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [First Vote] When casting the first vote in a new round, does the default-to in `(default-to u0 (map-get? tally tally-key))` correctly initialize the tally? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Simultaneous Threshold] If exactly threshold-weight votes are cast, is the >= comparison correct or should it be > for strict majority? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: update-last-round()] [Round Zero] Can round u0 be used as the first round, or does the match on map-get? require round to start at u1? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-threshold-weight()] [Zero Total Weight] If total-weight is u0 (no signers), does the function return u0 threshold, allowing any vote to pass? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Single Signer] If only one signer exists with 100% weight, can they approve any key without additional validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Cycle Boundary] What prevents voting for the next reward cycle before the current cycle's prepare phase, potentially front-running legitimate votes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: current-reward-cycle()] [Cycle Calculation] Does burn-block-height accurately reflect the current chain state, and can reorgs affect reward cycle calculations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: burn-height-to-reward-cycle()] [Division Rounding] Does integer division in reward cycle calculation cause off-by-one errors at cycle boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Competing Keys] Can multiple aggregate public keys accumulate votes in parallel, and does the first to reach threshold always win regardless of total support? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Vote Splitting] If signers vote for different keys across multiple rounds, can this prevent any key from reaching threshold, causing indefinite voting? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Tally Isolation] Are tallies properly isolated by round, preventing votes from round N from being counted toward round N+1's consensus? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-and-cache-total-weight()] [Cache Invalidation] Once cached, the total weight is never recalculated - if the signer set changes, can this cause permanent threshold miscalculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Weight Snapshot] Is the signer-weight retrieved from .signers at vote time, or is a historical snapshot used, and can weight changes mid-cycle affect voting? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-and-cache-total-weight()] [Concurrent Caching] If multiple votes in the same block try to cache total weight simultaneously, can this cause race conditions or duplicate work? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Block Ordering] Does transaction ordering within a block affect voting outcomes, particularly when multiple votes reach threshold simultaneously? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Mempool Front-Running] Can an attacker observe pending votes in the mempool and submit competing votes with higher fees to reach threshold first? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Key Collision] What is the probability of two distinct aggregate public keys hashing to the same buff 33 value in the maps? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Signing Assumption] Does the contract assume that approved aggregate public keys will be used correctly for threshold signatures elsewhere in the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Event Ordering] Are print events for 'voted' and 'approved-aggregate-public-key' emitted in the correct order, and can event observers rely on this ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Event Data] Does the voted event include sufficient information to audit vote legitimacy, or can malicious votes appear legitimate in events? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Constant: threshold-consensus] [Threshold Hardcoding] Is the 70% threshold (u70) appropriate for all network sizes, or can small signer sets be vulnerable to collusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Constant: pox-info] [Static Info] The pox-info is fetched once at deploy - if PoX parameters change, does this break voting logic? (High)"
