  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Burnchain Error Handling] Any error other than ShutdownInitiated on line 432 logs and exits - can transient burnchain errors cause permanent node shutdown when they should be retryable? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Miner Status Race] check_is_miner is called on line 443, and is_miner is set on line 444 - if another thread checks is_miner() during this window, can it see stale None value and make wrong decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Relay Buffer Overflow] The sync_channel with RELAYER_MAX_BUFFER on line 447 creates a bounded channel - if the relayer is slow and the buffer fills up, can send operations block or panic, DoSing block propagation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Mine Start Manipulation] The mine_start parameter on line 408 is used to set globals on line 457 - if this value is manipulated to be very high, can it prevent mining indefinitely even when the chain tip is reached? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Coordinator Resume Attack] announce_new_burn_block on line 473 triggers coordinator to process stored sortitions - if an attacker can inject fake sortitions into storage, can they cause the coordinator to process invalid blocks on resume? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Sortition Wait Deadlock] wait_for_sortitions on line 483 waits for sn.block_height + 1 if at first block - if no new sortitions arrive, can this deadlock the startup process indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Expect Panic] The expect on line 484 'Unable to get burnchain tip' will panic if wait_for_sortitions fails - can burnchain communication errors cause permanent startup failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Last Sortition Race] set_last_sortition on line 490 stores the snapshot globally - if another thread reads this before it's set, or if it's set to a stale value, can this cause mining to start at the wrong height? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Burnchain DB Corruption] The open_burnchain_db on line 498 expects success - if the DB is corrupted, will the node panic and be unable to recover without manual intervention? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Canonical Tip Query Failure] get_canonical_chain_tip on line 501 expects success - if the burnchain DB has no tip (corrupted or empty), will this panic prevent node startup? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Wait Timeout] wait_for_sortitions on line 504 waits for burnchain_db_tip height - if the burnchain is ahead but sortitions haven't been processed, can this wait block indefinitely? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Counter Manipulation] counters.bump_blocks_processed on line 509 increments a counter - if this counter overflows after processing many blocks, can it wrap around and cause incorrect metrics or trigger overflow-dependent bugs?

  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Height Initialization] sortition_db_height and burnchain_height are both set to rc_aligned_height on lines 511-512 - if rc_aligned_height is calculated incorrectly, can this cause the node to start processing from the wrong reward cycle boundary? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Reward Cycle Calculation] The block_height_to_reward_cycle on line 519 has expect for 'not in reward cycle' - if burnchain_height is somehow before the first reward cycle, will this panic? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Tenure Tracking] last_tenure_sortition_height is initialized to 0 on line 528 - if the chain has already progressed, can this zero value cause redundant processing or logging? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/nakamoto.rs] [Function: start()] [Poll Deadline Initialization] poll_deadline is initialized to 0 on line 529 - will this cause immediate polling on the first iteration, potentially DoSing the burnchain with rapid requests? (Low)",
