  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_hint_replicas()] [List Iteration] At lines 286-371, the function iterates through hint_replicas_list without checking if the list length exceeds MAX_HINT_REPLICAS (128) - is this validated by the type system at line 94-109 in REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS, or could a malicious contract bypass this? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Integer Truncation] At line 497, chunk_size (u128) is cast to u64 with 'as u64' - if chunk_size is between u64::MAX and u128::MAX, this will silently truncate. Is the check at line 410 sufficient to prevent this? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Write Frequency Overflow] At lines 427-437, write_freq is checked against u64::MAX before casting at line 499, but what happens if write_freq is exactly u64::MAX and later arithmetic operations on write_freq cause overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Max Writes Validation] At lines 444-454, max_writes is checked against u32::MAX and cast at line 500 - could an attacker set max_writes to 0 to disable write limits entirely, or is there validation elsewhere that prevents this? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Neighbors Override] At lines 474-482, if max_neighbors from the contract exceeds local_max_neighbors, the local value is used - but could an attacker set a contract max_neighbors to 0 to force the override logic and potentially cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Hint Replicas Override] At lines 484-494, local_hint_replicas completely replaces contract-specified replicas if present - could this create a DoS vector where an operator must manually specify replicas for every StackerDB, or fail to load the DB? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [usize Conversion] At line 502, max_neighbors is cast from u128 to usize - on 32-bit systems, if max_neighbors is between u32::MAX and u128::MAX, could this cause integer truncation despite the check at line 462? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Contract Execution Error] At lines 388-400, if the contract returns Err, the error code is extracted with expect_u128() - could a malicious contract return a different error type to cause a panic during error handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Chunk Size Validation] At lines 410-420, STACKERDB_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE is checked, but what is the minimum valid chunk_size? Could an attacker set chunk_size to 0 or 1 to cause DoS or memory exhaustion when allocating chunk buffers? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: eval_config()] [Signers Parameter] The signers Vec is passed in at line 380 but never validated for emptiness - could an attacker pass an empty signers list that was validated by eval_signer_slots() but causes issues in the resulting StackerDBConfig? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Chain Tip Race] At lines 515-517, the canonical block header is fetched, but between this call and the subsequent eval_read_only() calls, could the chain tip change causing inconsistent state reads? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Contract Analysis Load] At lines 539-541, load_contract_analysis() returns None if the contract doesn't exist - but could a race condition allow a contract to be deployed after the initial check but before analysis loading?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [None Result Handling] At lines 561-570, if with_read_only_clarity_tx() returns None, an error is returned, but is this path reachable in normal operation or only during catastrophic failures? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Boot Contract Logging] At lines 572-583, boot contracts get debug-level logging while user contracts get warn-level - could this inconsistency in error visibility allow boot contract issues to go unnoticed in production? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Signer Slots Before Config] At lines 587-596, eval_signer_slots() is called before eval_config(), but both functions call eval_read_only() - could the contract state change between these two calls if it tracks call counts or has time-dependent logic? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Function: from_smart_contract()] [Index Handle] At line 532, index_handle_at_block() is called with chain_tip_hash - if this fails, what guarantees exist that the failure is caught before being passed to eval functions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Constant: REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS] [List Size Mismatch] At line 77, STACKERDB_PAGE_LIST_MAX is used for the signer slots list maximum, but could a contract return a list that's dynamically larger than this limit and bypass validation? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/stackerdb/config.rs] [Constant: REQUIRED_FUNCTIONS] [Response Type Validation] Lines 69-82 and 88-113 define response types with UIntType as the error type - could a contract use a different error type that still satisfies TypeSignature validation? (Medium)"
