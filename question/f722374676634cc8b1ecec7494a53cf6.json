  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Struct: BlockValidateOk] [Cost and Size Reporting] Reporting execution cost and size in response - can this leak information about node capabilities or validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Static Validation Bypass] validate_normal_nakamoto_block_burnchain is called but results not checked until later - can this cause partial validation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Expected Burn Option Handling] expected_burn_opt is passed to validation - if None is incorrectly handled, can blocks pass without burn validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Burn Spent Validation] Block header burn_spent is passed to builder but not independently verified - can miners lie about burn spent? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [PoX Treatment Length] Block header pox_treatment.len() used without validation - can incorrect lengths cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Tenure Begin/Finish Atomicity] builder.tenure_begin and builder.tenure_finish are separate calls - can failure between them leave partial state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Miner Tenure Info Race] load_tenure_info is called with mutable chainstate - can concurrent access cause race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Burn Chain Height Consistency] burn_chain_height from miner_tenure_info used in mine_nakamoto_block - can this mismatch with actual burn height? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Path Regex Bypass] The regex ^/v3/block_proposal$ is anchored - but can path traversal or encoding bypass this? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: verb()] [HTTP Verb Enforcement] Only POST is allowed - but is this enforced at protocol level or can GET/PUT bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Query String Handling] query parameter is captured but never validated - can malicious query strings cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: hex_ser_block()] [Serialization Determinism] to_hex(&b.serialize_to_vec()) must be deterministic - can non-deterministic serialization cause consensus issues? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: hex_deser_block()] [Deserialization Bomb] No size limit before hex_bytes conversion - can extremely large hex strings cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Struct: NakamotoBlockProposal] [Replay Txs Optional Validation] replay_txs is Option<Vec> - can attackers send empty Vec vs None to bypass replay logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Struct: NakamotoBlockProposal] [Chain ID Deserialization] chain_id is u32 - can values outside valid range cause confusion or validation bypass? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Builder Construction Race] NakamotoBlockBuilder::new can fail - is failure handling atomic with validation state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Tenure Transaction Leak] tenure_tx is passed mutably through validation - can transaction state leak between validations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Block Mining Modification] mine_nakamoto_block returns new block - can this differ from proposal in unexpected ways? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Error Message Information Leakage] warn! logs include detailed block structure - can attackers use this to fingerprint node state? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Error Reason String Injection] error messages include %consensus_hash and similar - can attacker-controlled values inject malicious logging? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Consensus Hash Lookup Failure] sort_tip lookup can return None - is the error message 'Failed to find sortition' accurate or could it hide other issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Sortition ID Index] sortdb.index_handle(&sort_tip.sortition_id) used twice - can sortition_id be invalidated between calls? (Medium)",
