  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [DoS] Is there any rate limiting on chunk retrievals per contract_identifier to prevent an attacker from overwhelming the node with requests for a single StackerDB? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Resource Leak] If with_node_state() on line 127 acquires locks on network state, can repeated failed requests cause lock contention or deadlocks that degrade node performance? (Medium)",
