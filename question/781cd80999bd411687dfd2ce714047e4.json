  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: CompletedTenure::from] [Tenure Clone] In the From implementations at lines 36-54, ConsensusHash and StacksBlockId are cloned. If these structures are large or the system processes many tenures, could the clone operations cause performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: make_tenure_downloaders()] [Early Return Without Cleanup] In make_tenure_downloaders(), multiple early continue statements exist (lines 380-427). If these are triggered repeatedly for the same tenure, could the tenure remain in the schedule indefinitely without being removed or flagged as undownloadable? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: run()] [Continue Without State Update] In run() lines 526, 529, 538, 558, 578, 612, the function uses continue to skip to the next iteration. If state that should have been updated before continue is skipped, could this leave downloaders or peers in inconsistent states? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: make_tenure_downloaders()] [Excessive Debug Output] In make_tenure_downloaders() lines 362-369, test_debug! logs extensive information about the downloader state. If this is enabled in production, could verbose logging cause performance degradation or disk exhaustion? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: is_empty()] [Debug Log Information Leak] In is_empty() line 232, the debug log includes downloader.tenure_id_consensus_hash, naddr, and state. If this information is sensitive or could be used to fingerprint the node, could enabling debug logs leak operational details to attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Struct: CompletedTenure] [Invariant Violation] CompletedTenure at lines 30-34 does not validate that start_block and end_block are within the same tenure_id. Could invalid CompletedTenure instances be created that violate tenure boundary invariants? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/download/nakamoto/tenure_downloader_set.rs] [Function: From<&mut NakamotoTenureDownloader>] [Mutable Reference Misuse] The From implementation at line 46 takes &mut NakamotoTenureDownloader but does not mutate it, only reads its fields. Could this mislead callers into thinking the downloader is modified, or prevent concurrent read access unnecessarily? (Low)"
