  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: get_blockstack_transactions()] [Classification Logic] The Burnchain::classify_transaction call at line 830 determines operation types. Can classification ambiguities cause different nodes to extract different operations from the same block? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: get_blockstack_transactions()] [PreStx Handling] PreStx operations are stored separately in a HashMap at line 827 and added at the end. Can this cause incorrect transaction ordering if PreStx ops should be interleaved? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: store_burnchain_db_entry()] [Duplicate Detection] The INSERT OR IGNORE at line 349 silently ignores duplicates. Should this instead verify that the duplicate has identical data, or can mismatches be silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: inner_get_burnchain_op()] [Query Correctness] The DISTINCT at line 772 suggests potential duplicates. If duplicates exist with different operation data, which one is returned? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: has_burnchain_block()] [Existence Check] The query at line 729 only checks for existence, not validity. Can a corrupted or partially-stored block return true, causing incorrect sync behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: get_burnchain_header()] [Indexer Dependency] The function at line 739 uses the indexer to get the header hash. Can an inconsistent indexer cause this to return the wrong header or None? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Schema: burnchain_db_block_headers] [Timestamp Integrity] The timestamp field at line 218 is stored as INTEGER. Can overflow or negative values cause incorrect timestamp comparisons? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Schema: burnchain_db_block_headers] [Parent Relationship] The parent_block_hash at line 214 has no foreign key constraint. Can this allow insertion of blocks with non-existent parents? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Schema: block_commit_metadata] [Index Coverage] The primary key at line 275 may not cover all query patterns efficiently. Can certain queries cause performance degradation on large databases? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Migrations: MIGRATIONS Array] [Version Gaps] The migrations array at lines 43-52 defines versions 2 and 3. If version 1 is assumed but never defined, can nodes fail to initialize properly? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Migrations: MIGRATIONS Array] [Ordering Dependency] The migrations must be applied in order at lines 593-626. Can out-of-order definitions in the array cause migration failures? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: connect()] [Create Flag] The create_flag at line 519 is set based on path checks. Can race conditions between checking and creating cause duplicate initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: connect()] [Read-Write Mode] The readwrite parameter at line 517 controls database permissions. Can read-only mode cause legitimate write operations to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: open()] [Schema Validation] The open function at line 682 doesn't call create_or_migrate. Can opening an old schema version cause runtime errors or data corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: has_burnchain_block_at_height()] [Multiple Blocks] The query at line 722 checks for any block at height. Can multiple blocks at the same height (due to forks) cause this to return true even if the canonical block is different? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: get_commit_in_block_at()] [Type Mismatch] The function takes block_ptr as u32 at line 1009 but uses it in a query expecting INTEGER. Can this cause type conversion issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: get_commit_at()] [Header Availability] If the indexer at line 1043 doesn't have the header, Ok(None) is returned. Can this hide errors where the header should exist? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: BurnchainDBTransaction::conn()] [Isolation Level] The conn() method at line 475 returns a reference to the transaction connection. Can operations through this bypass transaction isolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: execute_batch()] [Atomicity] The execute_batch at line 484 runs multiple statements. Are these atomic within the transaction, or can partial execution occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/db.rs] [Function: set_anchor_block()] [Reward Cycle Validation] The target_reward_cycle parameter at line 374 is not validated before use. Can invalid reward cycle values cause database corruption? (High)"
