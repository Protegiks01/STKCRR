  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Constant: PATH] [Version Mismatch] The endpoint is versioned as '/v3/' at line 33 - does this enforce Nakamoto-era protocol rules, or can pre-Nakamoto blocks be submitted to this v3 endpoint causing version confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Network ID Validation] Does the block validation at line 163 ensure the block's network ID (mainnet/testnet) matches the node's configured network, preventing cross-network block submission? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Relay Queue Overflow] At line 199, `set_relay_message` adds the block to a relay queue - is there a bound on queue size? Can attackers submit many accepted blocks to overflow the queue and cause message loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Message Ordering Guarantees] When blocks are added to the relay queue at line 199, are there ordering guarantees? Can blocks be relayed out-of-order causing peers to reject them due to missing parents? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [JSON Serialization Determinism] At line 205, `HttpResponseContents::try_from_json` serializes the response - is this serialization deterministic?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Response Size Limits] At line 205, is there a size limit on the JSON response? Can an extremely long error message or block ID cause response truncation or buffer issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block Processing Cost] At line 163, `process_new_nakamoto_block_ext` performs full block validation - can attackers submit syntactically valid but consensus-invalid blocks that consume maximum validation resources before being rejected? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_v3.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Parsing Cost DoS] Can attackers submit payloads that maximize deserialization cost at line 131 while staying under MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN, such as deeply nested structures or long transaction lists? (Medium)"
