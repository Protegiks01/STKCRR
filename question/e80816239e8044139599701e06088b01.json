  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [Macro: BITVEC_LEN!] [Truncation] The final cast 'as u32' could truncate the result if the computed length exceeds u32::MAX - could this cause consensus divergence when nodes with different bitvec size limits process the same data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [Macro: BITVEC_LEN!] [Off-by-One] Is the condition ($bitvec) % 8 > 0 correct for all edge cases, or could a bitvec length of exactly 0 or 8*n produce unexpected length calculations that cause buffer size mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [Macro: BITVEC_LEN!] [DoS] Could an attacker provide a maliciously large $bitvec value that causes the length calculation to produce a huge u32, leading to excessive memory allocation in code that uses this macro result? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [Macro: BITVEC_LEN!] [Consensus Divergence] If $bitvec is a runtime value rather than a constant, could different compiler optimizations produce different evaluation orders that affect the result due to integer overflow semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [Macro: BITVEC_LEN!] [Arithmetic Error] Does the division by 8 handle negative input values correctly if $bitvec is a signed type, or could negative bitlength values cause undefined behavior or incorrect length calculations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Consensus Divergence] Are there any types that could be serialized using both impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int! and impl_byte_array_message_codec!, potentially creating non-deterministic serialization where the choice depends on type resolution order? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Error Handling] Do the Error::WriteError and Error::ReadError wrappers preserve the underlying IO error codes consistently across all macro instantiations, ensuring that network errors are handled deterministically? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Consensus Divergence] Could different monomorphization of these generic macros across compilation units lead to different binary code paths that handle edge cases differently, causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [DoS] Is there any limit on the total number of bytes that can be read during deserialization, or could an attacker cause unbounded reads by chaining multiple deserialize operations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [State Corruption] If a Write or Read implementation has internal buffering, could partial flushes or incomplete reads create inconsistent serialization state that's only visible during node restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int! & BITVEC_LEN!] [Integration] If BITVEC_LEN! is used to determine buffer sizes for integer deserialization, could arithmetic overflow in BITVEC_LEN! cause undersized buffers that lead to buffer overruns in read_exact? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Type Safety] Could incorrect type instantiation where the actual byte length of $thing doesn't match $len cause the expect() on line 39 to become reachable, indicating a type system violation that should be impossible? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Determinism] Are there any floating-point types that could be passed as $typ, and if so, could NaN or infinity values serialize differently across platforms, causing consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Zero-Length] What happens when $len is 0 - does [0u8; 0] create an empty array that's handled correctly by as_bytes() and from_bytes(), or could this cause special-case bugs in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Precision] For very large bitvec lengths, could the u32 cast lose precision in a way that causes the calculated length to be smaller than required, leading to truncated deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Resource Exhaustion] Could an attacker cause resource exhaustion by providing inputs that trigger worst-case behavior in all three macros simultaneously, multiplying the resource consumption? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Endianness] Is to_be_bytes() truly platform-independent, or could unusual architectures (e.g., mixed-endian) cause different serialization outputs that break consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Array Initialization] Does [0u8; ($len as usize)] guarantee zero-initialization on all platforms, or could uninitialized memory be exposed if the array allocation fails or is optimized away? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Macro Hygiene] Could the macro expansion capture variables from the calling context if $bitvec contains complex expressions, leading to unexpected evaluation behavior or variable shadowing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Error Recovery] If consensus_deserialize fails partway through reading a batch of integers, does the Read stream position remain consistent, or could misalignment cause subsequent reads to deserialize garbage data as valid integers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Timing Attacks] Could the time taken by from_bytes validation leak information about the buffer contents, enabling timing attacks that help an attacker craft consensus-violating payloads? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Fuzzing Gaps] Are there input combinations that would never be generated by standard fuzzing (e.g., specific bit patterns or sizes) that could trigger edge cases in these macros? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Type Inference] If $bitvec is an expression with multiple possible types, could type inference select different types in different contexts, causing the division and modulo operations to produce different results? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Atomicity] Does the Write trait guarantee that write_all either writes all bytes or returns an error without partial writes, or could partial writes corrupt the serialization stream? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Memory Alignment] Could the stack-allocated buffer [0u8; ($len as usize)] have incorrect alignment for the $thing type, causing from_bytes to exhibit undefined behavior when reading structured data? (High)"
