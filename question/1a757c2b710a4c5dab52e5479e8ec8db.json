  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Input Validation] Can the regex pattern on lines 54-57 be bypassed with specially crafted principal addresses or contract names that exploit regex anchoring or character class edge cases to inject malicious paths? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [ReDoS] Does the regex pattern combining STANDARD_PRINCIPAL_REGEX_STRING and CONTRACT_NAME_REGEX_STRING create potential for catastrophic backtracking that could cause denial of service when processing malicious input paths? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Path Traversal] Can an attacker craft a path that matches the regex but contains encoded characters or unicode normalization issues that bypass validation after the contract_identifier is extracted? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [State Corruption] If try_parse_request() partially succeeds but fails after setting some fields (lines 87-89), could this leave the handler in an inconsistent state that affects subsequent requests?

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Integer Parsing] Does the regex pattern `[0-9]+` for slot_id and slot_version allow leading zeros that could be interpreted inconsistently (e.g., as octal) in downstream parsing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Race Condition] The comment on lines 104-109 warns about streaming race conditions, but does the non-streaming implementation using get_chunk() and get_latest_chunk() still have race conditions where a chunk is modified between the lookup and the response send?
