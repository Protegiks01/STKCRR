  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Network Security] The org field is hardcoded to 0 with a TODO comment on line 204. Can this cause incorrect peer organization classification, allowing Sybil attacks where an attacker controls multiple ASNs in the same org? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Network Security] If the sorted ASN list contains overlapping prefixes (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.1.0.0/16), which entry takes precedence during lookup? Can this be exploited for ASN misclassification? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a prefix with mask /8 that covers critical infrastructure IP ranges, causing the node to misclassify legitimate peers as belonging to an attacker's ASN? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Network Security] The ASN and org fields are u32, allowing values up to 4 billion. Are there reserved ASN ranges (e.g., private ASNs 64512-65534) that should be rejected but aren't? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Network Security] After sorting by prefix, entries with longer masks (/24) may come before shorter masks (/8) for the same prefix. Does this affect longest-prefix matching in downstream code? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Memory Safety] The prefix_octets array is fixed at 4 elements, but the zip iterator on line 166 relies on the split() result having exactly 4 elements. Can a logic error cause out-of-bounds access? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Type Safety] The prefix field stores the IP as a single u32 in big-endian format. Can endianness issues arise on different architectures when comparing or serializing prefixes? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [String Handling] The buf_full.trim() on line 111 creates a new String. For extremely large files with many lines, can this cause excessive memory allocation and fragmentation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Memory Safety] The asn4 vector grows without capacity pre-allocation. For files with millions of entries, can this cause repeated reallocations and memory spikes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [ReDoS] The regex pattern on line 51 uses multiple [0-9]+ groups. Can an attacker craft input with many digits that causes exponential backtracking, leading to CPU exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Regex Complexity] The whitespace regex on line 53 matches comment lines with '.+'. Can extremely long comment lines cause regex engine performance degradation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Regex Bypass] The regex allows tabs and spaces but no other whitespace. Can vertical tabs, form feeds, or other Unicode whitespace characters bypass validation but be accepted by trim()? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Regex Construction] The regexes are constructed with .unwrap() on lines 50-53. If the patterns are ever modified incorrectly, will this cause a panic at runtime? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Path Traversal] The function accepts a String path without validation. Can an attacker provide '../../../etc/passwd' to read arbitrary files from the system? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [Symlink Attack] If the ASN file is a symlink to a sensitive file or a FIFO/socket, can this cause the node to block indefinitely or leak sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [I/O Error Handling] The read_line error on line 102-104 is mapped to FilesystemError. Can transient I/O errors (e.g., network filesystem timeouts) cause permanent ASN database loading failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: from_file()] [TOCTOU Race] Between opening the file and reading its contents, can an attacker replace it with a different file, causing inconsistent ASN data to be loaded? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Data Validation] After parsing prefix octets, there's no verification that the prefix is valid for the given mask (e.g., host bits should be zero). Can this cause ambiguous or overlapping ranges? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Duplicate Detection] There's no check for duplicate entries (same prefix and mask). Can duplicate entries in the file cause the vector to grow unnecessarily or create ambiguous lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Struct: ASEntry4] [Data Consistency] The org field is always set to 0. Can downstream code that relies on org values for security decisions be bypassed because all peers appear to be in the same organization? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Validation Order] Sorting happens after all entries are parsed. If an invalid entry causes parsing to fail, previously parsed valid entries are discarded. Is this the intended behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Edge Case] What happens if the input file contains only comments and whitespace, resulting in an empty asn4 vector? Can this cause crashes in downstream code that expects non-empty ASN data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Edge Case] Can an entry with mask=8 and prefix=0.0.0.0 (matching all IPs) be used to classify all peers under a single ASN, breaking peer diversity assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4()] [Edge Case] Can an entry with mask=24 and prefix with non-zero host bits (e.g., 192.168.1.5/24) cause incorrect subnet calculations in downstream code? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/asn.rs] [Function: read_asn4_sequence()] [Edge Case] If the file contains exactly one valid entry followed by EOF, does the parsing succeed, or does the PermanentlyDrained error on the second read cause issues? (Low)"
