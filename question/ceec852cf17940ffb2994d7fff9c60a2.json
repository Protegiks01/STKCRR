(Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getconstantval.rs] [Function: restart()] [Incomplete Reset] Does the restart() function at lines 103-106 properly clear all handler state, or can residual data from previous requests leak into subsequent requests in a connection-pooled environment?
