  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: RewardSetEventPayload] [Stacked Amount] The stacked_amt u128 field (line 106) - could overflow in sum calculations when computing total stacked amount across all signers cause incorrect weight distributions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: RewardSetEventPayload] [Signer Weight] The weight u32 field (line 107) - is this computed deterministically from stacked_amt, and could weight calculation errors cause incorrect quorum thresholds? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: RewardSetEventPayload] [Optional Signers] The signers field is Option<Vec<NakamotoSignerEntryPayload>> (line 96) - could None be used for Nakamoto-era reward sets where signers should be required, hiding missing signer data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: RewardSetEventPayload] [PoX Threshold] The pox_ustx_threshold Option<u128> (line 98) - if None when it should have a value, could this cause incorrect PoX participation validation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Transaction Index] The tx_index u32 field (line 168) - could this index be inconsistent with the actual position in the block, causing incorrect transaction ordering in indexers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Status String] The status is &'a str (line 170) - could custom status strings outside the defined constants (STATUS_RESP_TRUE, etc.) be assigned, breaking status interpretation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Raw Result Cloning] The raw_result Value field (line 173) - could large Clarity values cause excessive memory usage when cloned across multiple event handlers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Contract Interface] The contract_interface Option<ContractInterface> (line 178) - if Some for non-contract transactions or None for contract publishes, could this cause indexing errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Burnchain Op Validation] The burnchain_op Option<BlockstackOperationType> (line 184) - could invalid burn operations (e.g., malformed PoX operations) be included without validation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Struct: TransactionEventPayload] [Microblock Consistency] The microblock_sequence, microblock_hash, and microblock_parent_hash (lines 188-194) - could inconsistent combinations (e.g., sequence with no hash) be constructed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: signer_entry_to_payload()] [Data Loss] The function only copies signing_key, stacked_amt, and weight (lines 143-147) - if NakamotoSignerEntry contains additional fields in future versions, could this cause information loss? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: from_reward_set()] [Clone Safety] The function clones rewarded_addresses and start_cycle_state (lines 151-152) - could these clones fail or produce inconsistent data if the source RewardSet is modified concurrently? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: from_reward_set()] [Signer Mapping] The signers are mapped using iter().map() (line 156) - could an empty signer list be mapped to Some(vec![]) instead of None, causing ambiguity? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Function: from_reward_set()] [Threshold Copying] The pox_ustx_threshold is copied directly (line 157) - if the source value is computed incorrectly, could this propagate incorrect thresholds to all event consumers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Constants: STATUS_RESP_*] [String Literal Safety] The status constants (lines 237-239) use static str literals - could typos or inconsistent casing cause status matching failures in downstream systems? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [Constants: STATUS_RESP_*] [Completeness] Only three status values are defined (success, abort_by_response, abort_by_post_condition) - are there other transaction outcomes (e.g., validation failures, cost overflows) that need distinct status codes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All serialization functions] [Determinism] Are all serialization functions (serialize_u128_as_string, serialize_pox_addresses, hex_serialize) deterministic across platforms, compiler versions, and endianness, ensuring identical events for identical blockchain states? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All payload functions] [Error Handling] Multiple functions use expect(), unwrap(), and unwrap_or_default() for error handling - could any of these panic conditions be triggered by valid but unusual blockchain states during chain reorganizations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All struct definitions] [Deserialization] While structs derive Serialize, only some derive Deserialize (TransactionEventPayload at line 162) - could inconsistent serialization/deserialization support cause issues when events need to be replayed or verified? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All hex formatting] [Prefix Consistency] Some fields use format!(\\",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All event payloads] [Size Limits] None of the payload construction functions enforce size limits on the resulting JSON - could extremely large blocks with many transactions cause event payloads to exceed HTTP limits or memory constraints? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/event_dispatcher/payloads.rs] [All event payloads] [Encoding Safety] The file uses serde_json for serialization - could malformed UTF-8 in transaction data or contract names cause JSON encoding failures or security issues? (Medium)"
