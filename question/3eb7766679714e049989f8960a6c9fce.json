  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Cache Poisoning] If responses are cached (either by the node or by intermediary proxies), can stale replica lists cause clients to connect to offline or malicious peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Database Injection] While get_contract_address likely validates input, can SQL injection occur in PeerDB::find_stacker_db_replicas if the contract_identifier is improperly escaped in the query? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Network Partition] If PeerDB returns replicas that are only reachable in a specific network partition, can this cause StackerDB synchronization to fail silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Version Compatibility] If NeighborAddress serialization format changes between protocol versions, can old clients correctly parse responses from new servers, or will this break compatibility? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Eclipse Attack] Can an attacker who controls many Sybil identities in PeerDB cause this endpoint to return only attacker-controlled replicas, eclipsing honest nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Resource Leakage] If node.with_node_state() acquires locks or resources, are they always released even if try_handle_request returns early due to errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [HTTP Smuggling] Can discrepancies between Content-Length validation and actual body parsing enable HTTP request smuggling or desync attacks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Amplification Attack] Can an attacker use this endpoint in an amplification attack by sending small requests that trigger large replica list responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Data Staleness] What is the maximum staleness of replica data that can be returned (based on max_neighbor_age), and can this lead to clients connecting to replicas that no longer serve the StackerDB? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error State Handling] If multiple errors occur (e.g., database error + serialization error), which error is reported to the client, and can error precedence mask critical issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: new_list_stackerdb_replicas()] [DNS Rebinding] If PeerHost is a DNS name rather than an IP, can DNS rebinding attacks cause the client to connect to unintended hosts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [Fingerprinting] Can the specific error messages, response timing, or replica list contents be used to fingerprint node implementations or configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Boolean Logic] Is the allow_private flag correctly passed through all code paths, or can it be accidentally inverted or ignored in some scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: decode_stackerdb_replicas()] [Memory Corruption] If the JSON payload contains extremely large integer values for port numbers or other numeric fields, can integer overflow during deserialization corrupt memory? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [General] [API Versioning] The endpoint is under /v2/ - if a breaking change is needed, how is backward compatibility maintained, and can version mismatches cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/liststackerdbreplicas.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Transaction Ordering] If this endpoint is called during critical StackerDB operations, can delays or failures in the response affect transaction ordering or block production? (Low)"
