  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: to_b58_version_byte()] [Mainnet/Testnet Confusion] Could an attacker convert a mainnet C32 address to a testnet Bitcoin address by manipulating the version byte conversion? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: legacy_address_type_to_version_byte()] [Type Safety] The function takes an enum LegacyBitcoinAddressType. Could an attacker create an invalid enum value through unsafe code or serialization? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: to_c32_version_byte()] [Consensus Critical] If different nodes have different C32_ADDRESS_VERSION constants, could version byte conversion cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::to_p2pkh_tx_out()] [Script Generation] The function builds a P2PKH script at lines 177-183. Could an attacker provide a malformed Hash160 that causes the script to be invalid but still accepted? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::to_p2sh_tx_out()] [Script Validation] The P2SH script at lines 191-195 uses push_slice(&bytes.0). Could providing 20 zero bytes create an unspendable output? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2wpkh_tx_out()] [Witness Version] The function uses OP_PUSHBYTES_0 at line 368. Could this be inconsistent with the witness version if the address has a different version? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2wsh_tx_out()] [Push Size] The function pushes 32 bytes at line 380. If the byte array has a different length, could this create malformed scripts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2tr_tx_out()] [Taproot Validation] The function uses OP_PUSHNUM_1 at line 390. Could an attacker provide non-taproot bytes that are still accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::to_p2pkh_tx_out()] [Value Overflow] The value parameter is u64. Could extremely large values cause issues when the TxOut is serialized? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::to_p2sh_tx_out()] [Opcode Order] The opcodes are OP_HASH160, push, OP_EQUAL. Could incorrect ordering cause consensus issues with Bitcoin Core? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2wpkh_tx_out()] [Segwit Activation] If these TxOuts are created before segwit activation, could they be invalid on Bitcoin? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2wsh_tx_out()] [Script Witness] The function doesn't validate that the bytes represent a valid witness script hash. Could this create unspendable outputs? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::to_p2tr_tx_out()] [Taproot Key] The function doesn't validate that the 32 bytes represent a valid taproot key. Could invalid keys create consensus issues? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Zero Hash Check] The function checks if bytes == Hash160([0u8; 20]). Could an attacker use a different 'burn' pattern that's accepted by some nodes but not others? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Loop Performance] Lines 623-627 iterate over all bytes checking for zero. Could this be optimized, and could the current implementation cause DoS with many burn checks? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Early Return] The function doesn't early return when finding a non-zero byte. Could this cause unnecessary computation? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: BitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Dispatch Consistency] Lines 669-674 dispatch to Legacy or Segwit implementations. Could there be edge cases where both report different burn status? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: LegacyBitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Consensus Critical] If 'burn' addresses are used for PoX operations, could incorrect burn detection cause reward distribution errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_burn()] [Type-Dependent Behavior] P2WPKH checks 20 bytes, P2WSH/P2TR check 32 bytes. Is this consistent with Bitcoin Core's burn address definition? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_p2wpkh()] [Pattern Matching] The function uses matches! macro at line 400. Could exhaustive matching issues cause this to accept invalid variants? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_p2wsh()] [Consistency] If a SegwitBitcoinAddress is constructed with wrong byte length, could is_p2wsh() return true but operations fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: SegwitBitcoinAddress::is_p2tr()] [Future Compatibility] If taproot rules change, could this check become incorrect? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: BitcoinAddress::is_segwit_p2wpkh()] [Type Extraction] Lines 518-522 extract the Segwit variant. Could this fail if the enum is corrupted? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: BitcoinAddress::is_segwit_p2wsh()] [Double Dispatch] The function dispatches twice (Legacy/Segwit, then type check). Could this introduce inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/address.rs] [Function: BitcoinAddress::is_segwit_p2tr()] [Network Independence] The type check doesn't consider network type. Could this cause confusion between mainnet and testnet P2TR addresses? (Medium)"
