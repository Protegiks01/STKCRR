  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Error Message Leakage] Do the FromSqlError messages reveal sensitive information about database contents or structure that could aid an attacker? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Transaction Isolation] If two concurrent transactions attempt to read/write the same hash value, could race conditions cause one to read partially-updated hex strings? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Foreign Key Constraints] If hash values are used as foreign keys, could deserialization errors cause constraint violations or orphaned records? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [Index Corruption] Could invalid hex strings in indexed columns cause SQLite index corruption or inconsistent query results? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 54] [ConsensusHash Burn Block Binding] Since ConsensusHash binds to Bitcoin burn blocks, could deserialization of an invalid hash break the PoX consensus link, causing sortition failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 56] [BlockHeaderHash Fork Resolution] Since BlockHeaderHash is used for fork choice, could deserialization errors cause nodes to disagree on the canonical chain tip? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 60] [TrieHash MARF Consistency] Since TrieHash represents MARF state roots, could deserialization mismatches cause nodes to compute different state roots for the same blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 63] [SortitionId History Integrity] Since SortitionId tracks sortition history, could deserialization errors cause nodes to have inconsistent views of the burnchain fork set? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 64] [StacksBlockId MARF Indexing] Since StacksBlockId is used as a MARF key, could deserialization errors cause blocks to be indexed incorrectly, breaking block retrieval? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [Odd-Length Hex] Does hex_bytes() properly reject hex strings with odd numbers of characters (which can't represent whole bytes), or attempt to parse them with undefined behavior? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [Negative Zero] Can hex strings representing negative values (if misinterpreted as signed integers) be stored, causing unexpected deserialization results? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [Integer Overflow] When hex_bytes() parses large hex strings, could the byte vector allocation overflow size_t on 32-bit systems? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Audit Logging] Are deserialization failures logged for security monitoring, or could repeated failures indicating an attack go unnoticed? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Input Validation Layering] Is deserialization validation the only layer preventing invalid hashes from entering the system, or are there additional checks at the application layer? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Function: Sha256dHash::to_sql()] [Output Sanitization] Does be_hex_string() escape or sanitize output to prevent any potential SQL injection if the hex string is later used in dynamic SQL? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Schema Evolution] If the database schema is upgraded to use BLOB instead of TEXT for hashes, would the FromSql implementations handle both types or require migration? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Function: StacksAddress::to_sql()] [C32 vs C32check] Does the address encoding use C32check (with checksum) or plain C32, and could mixing these formats cause address validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Line 28] [NO_PARAMS Usage] Is the NO_PARAMS constant at line 28 used correctly throughout the codebase, or could misuse cause parameterized queries to execute with unexpected values? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [All Implementations] [Memory Safety] Do all FromSql implementations avoid any unsafe code or memory operations that could cause buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/types/sqlite.rs] [Macro: impl_byte_array_rusqlite_only!] [Copy Semantics] Does the from_bytes() call in the macro correctly copy bytes into the fixed-size array, or could pointer aliasing cause memory corruption? (High)"
