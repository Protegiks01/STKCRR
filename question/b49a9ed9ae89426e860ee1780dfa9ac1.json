  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Access Control] Since this function is defined as `define-private`, what prevents malicious smart contracts from calling it directly to overwrite signer slots for arbitrary reward cycles, potentially causing consensus divergence between nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [State Consistency] Can an attacker call this function multiple times for the same reward-cycle with different signer-slots lists, causing the last write to win and potentially creating inconsistent stackerdb configurations across nodes that process blocks in different orders? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Integer Overflow] The modulo operation `(mod reward-cycle u2)` determines which variable to update - can supplying a reward-cycle value near uint max cause integer overflow or unexpected behavior when computing the cycle-mod? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [State Race Condition] The function sets three pieces of state (cycle-set-height map, last-set-cycle var, and one of the signer-slots vars) - if execution is interrupted between these updates, could this leave the contract in an inconsistent state where last-set-cycle points to a cycle with incomplete data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Input Validation] There is no validation that the signer-slots list is non-empty - can setting an empty list for a reward cycle cause downstream consumers (stackerdb contracts) to malfunction or reject all messages? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Input Validation] The function accepts num-slots values without bounds checking - can a malicious caller provide num-slots values that sum to more than the maximum allowed slots, causing resource exhaustion or incorrect slot allocation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Input Validation] What prevents duplicate signer principals in the signer-slots list, and could duplicates cause double-counting of slots or ambiguity in stackerdb message routing? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Timestamp Validation] The set-at-height parameter records when slots were set, but there's no validation that this height is less than or equal to the current block height - can future heights be set, causing timestamp confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Data Overwrite] Since map-set overwrites existing entries without checking, can calling this function for a past reward-cycle retroactively change the historical signer configuration and violate immutability assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-set-signer-slots()] [Cycle Ordering] There is no check that reward-cycle is greater than last-set-cycle - can setting cycles out of order (e.g., cycle 10 then cycle 5) cause state inconsistency where last-set-cycle incorrectly points to an older cycle? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Atomicity Violation] The function requires `last-set-cycle` to equal `reward-cycle`, creating a dependency on stackerdb-set-signer-slots() being called first - if a node calls set-signers() before stackerdb-set-signer-slots() due to transaction ordering, will this permanently prevent that cycle's signers from being set? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [State Consistency] If stackerdb-set-signer-slots() is called for cycle N but set-signers() fails the assertion check, the cycle-set-height and stackerdb slots will be set but cycle-signer-set will not - can this inconsistent state cause consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Input Validation] The signers list accepts weight values without bounds - can a weight of u0 or uint max cause arithmetic issues in voting or reward distribution calculations that consume this data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Input Validation] What prevents an empty signers list from being set for a reward cycle, and would an empty list cause all voting or consensus operations to fail for that cycle? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Input Validation] Can duplicate signer principals with different weights be added to the list, potentially causing double-voting or incorrect vote aggregation in downstream contracts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [List Length Mismatch] The signers list can hold up to 4000 entries while signer-slots lists also have 4000 capacity - is there validation that these lists have the same length and order, or can mismatches cause index-based lookups to return wrong signers? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Access Control] Like stackerdb-set-signer-slots, this is defined as `define-private` - what mechanism prevents unauthorized calls, and could a vulnerability in the calling context allow arbitrary signer set manipulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Reentrancy] If the signers list contains contract principals, could setting signers trigger callbacks that re-enter set-signers() or stackerdb-set-signer-slots() before the first call completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Data Overwrite] Can calling set-signers() multiple times for the same cycle with different signer lists allow an attacker to manipulate which signers are active, potentially excluding legitimate signers? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: set-signers()] [Weight Sum Validation] There is no check that signer weights sum to an expected total or that the distribution is valid - can incorrect weight totals cause consensus failures in threshold signature validation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: get-signers()] [Missing Data] This function returns `none` if the cycle doesn't exist in cycle-signer-set - can callers distinguish between a cycle that hasn't been set yet vs. a cycle that was set with an empty list? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: get-signers()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Since this is read-only, can the returned signer list become stale if set-signers() is called in the same block after get-signers() is queried? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: get-signers()] [Cache Consistency] If different nodes call get-signers() at slightly different block heights, could they see different signer sets for the same cycle, causing fork divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-get-signer-slots-page()] [Page Boundary Error] The function only handles page u0 and u1 - if the maximum list size of 4000 entries exceeds what can fit in a single page, does this pagination scheme correctly partition the data or could entries be lost? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers.clar] [Function: stackerdb-get-signer-slots-page()] [Data Staleness] The function returns the current value of stackerdb-signer-slots-0 or stackerdb-signer-slots-1 without checking if they correspond to the active reward cycle - can callers receive outdated slot configurations? (High)"
