  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_BLACKLIST_TIMEOUT] [Timeout Value] Set to 48 hours. Could a transaction blacklisted near the end of a tenure become un-blacklisted in the next tenure, allowing resubmission with slightly different fees? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Constant: DEFAULT_BLACKLIST_MAX_SIZE] [Size Limit] Set to 2^27 entries (128MB at 128 bytes/record). Could an attacker deliberately trigger blacklisting of many transactions to fill this table and cause DoS through random deletions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Table: tx_blacklist_size] [Size Tracking] Uses triggers to maintain count. Could concurrent transactions cause the trigger count to desynchronize from actual table size? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: garbage_collect()] [Behavior Selection] Switches between ByStacksHeight and ByReceiveTime based on MempoolCollectionBehavior. Could incorrect behavior selection after epoch transition cause transactions to be collected too early or retained too long? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_by_coinbase_height()] [Height Subtraction] Uses chain_height.checked_sub(MEMPOOL_MAX_TRANSACTION_AGE). Returns Ok(()) if subtraction underflows. Could this cause mempool to never be garbage collected in the first 256 blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_by_time()] [Time Threshold] Uses saturating_sub for threshold calculation. Could clock skew or time manipulation cause premature or delayed garbage collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_by_coinbase_height()] [Event Observer Notification] Queries txids before deletion to notify observers. Could a race condition cause txids to be reported as dropped but not actually deleted? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Constant: MEMPOOL_MAX_TRANSACTION_AGE] [Age Limit] Set to 256 blocks. In Nakamoto with faster block times, could this cause transactions to be collected too quickly, preventing legitimate high-nonce transactions from being mined? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Constant: MEMPOOL_NAKAMOTO_MAX_TRANSACTION_AGE] [Duration-Based GC] Set to 256 * 10 * 60 seconds (25.6 hours). Could this be insufficient for transactions submitted during long tenure periods in Nakamoto? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: garbage_collect_by_coinbase_height()] [Foreign Key Cascade] Deleting from mempool triggers cascading deletes to other tables. Could this cause performance issues when garbage collecting many transactions at once? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: apply_schema_migrations()] [Panic on Unknown Version] The function panics on unknown schema versions. Could a corrupted database with invalid version number crash the node on startup? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: instantiate_mempool_db()] [Transaction Rollback] Uses tx_begin_immediate but doesn't handle partial migration failures. Could a failed migration leave the database in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Schema: MEMPOOL_INITIAL_SCHEMA] [Unique Constraints] Has UNIQUE constraints on (origin_address, origin_nonce) and (sponsor_address, sponsor_nonce). Could these constraints conflict in legitimate multi-sig or complex transaction scenarios? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Schema: MEMPOOL_SCHEMA_8_NONCE_SORTING] [Index Dropping] Drops by_txid, by_sponsor, and by_origin indexes as redundant. Could queries that relied on these indexes experience performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Schema: fee_estimates table] [Foreign Key Cascade] Has ON DELETE CASCADE on txid foreign key. Could rapid transaction replacement cause cascading deletes to thrash the fee_estimates table? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Schema: randomized_txids table] [Foreign Key Constraint] References mempool(txid) with ON DELETE CASCADE. Could orphaned randomized_txids entries exist if cascade fails, breaking mempool sync? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: get_schema_version()] [Version Query] Returns MAX(version) from schema_version table. Could multiple schema version entries cause confusion about the actual current schema? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Schema: nonces table] [Primary Key on Address] Uses address as primary key. Could address string representation inconsistencies cause duplicate entries or lookup failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: estimate_tx_rates()] [Concurrent Updates] Updates fee_rate without locks. Could concurrent estimate_tx_rates calls update the same transaction, causing lost updates or inconsistent fee rates? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: estimate_tx_rates()] [Error Handling] Continues on EstimatorError::NoEstimateAvailable but logs other errors. Could systematic estimator errors cause all transactions to have NULL fee_rate, breaking fee-based sorting? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: estimate_tx_rates()] [Max Updates Limit] Only processes max_updates transactions per call. Could this cause fee estimates to lag significantly behind mempool growth during high traffic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Struct: MemPoolWalkSettings] [Consider No Estimate Probability] Default is 5%. Could this low probability cause many no-estimate transactions to never be mined, even if they have high absolute fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Struct: MemPoolWalkSettings] [Cost Limit Percentages] tenure_cost_limit_per_block_percentage and contract_cost_limit_percentage are optional. Could None values cause miners to consume entire cost limits too quickly, preventing late-arriving high-fee transactions from being included? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Function: submit()] [Estimator Error Handling] Returns EstimatorError for non-NoEstimateAvailable errors. Could transient estimator failures prevent valid transactions from entering the mempool? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/core/mempool.rs] [Struct: CandidateCache] [Cache Size Assertion] Uses debug assertions to check cache size. Could production builds violate max_cache_size constraint, causing unbounded memory growth? (Medium)"
