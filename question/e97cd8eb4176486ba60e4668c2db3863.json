  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Integration] [Deserialization Consistency] Do parse_bytestream(), parse_json(), and parse_bytes() handle empty body slices consistently, or could an attacker exploit differences in empty input handling to cause parser confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Integration] [Error Type Consistency] The three parsing functions return different error types (Error::DecodeError, Error::UnderflowError) - could inconsistent error handling in callers lead to some errors being swallowed or mishandled? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Integration] [Content-Type Enforcement] All three parsing functions check preamble.content_type - but what prevents an attacker from providing a preamble where the declared content_type doesn't match the actual body content, causing mismatched parsing? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Integration] [Preamble Trust] All parsing functions trust the HttpResponsePreamble parameter - if the preamble itself is parsed from untrusted input, could vulnerabilities in preamble parsing (not in this file) cascade into these parsing functions? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Integration] [Body Slice Lifetime] All functions take &[u8] body slices - could there be lifetime issues where the body buffer is freed or modified while parsing is in progress, causing use-after-free? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Enum: HttpVersion] [Version Confusion] The enum defines Http10 = 0x10 and Http11 = 0x11 - could arithmetic operations on these repr(u8) values cause unexpected behavior, especially if future versions are added? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Enum: HttpVersion] [Missing Validation] Is there validation elsewhere that ensures only Http10 or Http11 are used, or could an attacker provide HTTP version bytes like 0x00, 0xFF, or 0x12 that get unsafely transmuted into the enum? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Architecture] [Missing Rate Limiting] None of the parsing functions implement rate limiting or connection tracking - can an attacker flood the node with parsing requests to exhaust CPU and memory? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Architecture] [No Request Size Validation] Besides max_len in parse_raw_bytes(), there's no global check on total request size - can an attacker send requests with headers and body totaling gigabytes to cause memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Architecture] [Synchronous Parsing] All parsing appears to be synchronous - could an attacker send many large requests that block threads during parsing, causing thread pool exhaustion and preventing legitimate requests from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Architecture] [No Timeout] There's no timeout mechanism visible in the parsing functions - can an attacker send slow data or trigger expensive parsing operations that run indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/http/common.rs] [Architecture] [Error Handling Completeness] All functions return Result<T, Error>, but are all error cases properly handled by callers, or could some panics or uncaught errors crash the node? (Medium)"
