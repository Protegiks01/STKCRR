  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_scheduled_block_rewards()] [Maturity Check] If tip.stacks_block_height < MINER_REWARD_MATURITY, returns empty vec - but what if MINER_REWARD_MATURITY is misconfigured? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_miner_info()] [Uniqueness] The query expects 0 or 1 miner, and panics if multiple miners exist for same consensus_hash/block_hash - can this panic be triggered by corrupted state? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_matured_miner_payment()] [Reward Reconstruction] When ret.len() == 2, the function tries to merge with try_add_parent, but panics on 'got two child rewards' or 'got two parent rewards' - can malicious database entries trigger these panics? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_matured_miner_payment()] [Genesis Handling] For genesis block identified by FIRST_BURNCHAIN_CONSENSUS_HASH and FIRST_STACKS_BLOCK_HASH, MinerReward::genesis is returned - can this be spoofed with fake genesis blocks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_matured_miner_payment()] [Unexpected Length] If ret.len() is not 0, 1, or 2, the function returns None - does this silently drop valid rewards in edge cases? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: inner_get_matured_miner_payments()] [SQL Filter] The query filters by vtxindex = 0 to get only miner rewards - can user rewards with vtxindex > 0 be maliciously inserted with vtxindex = 0? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Maturity Validation] If tip_stacks_height <= MINER_REWARD_MATURITY, returns None - but can off-by-one errors here cause premature or delayed reward maturation? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Array Indexing] latest_matured_miners.first() expects a non-empty vec with asserts, but what if the vec is empty due to database corruption? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Vec Manipulation] split_off(1) separates users from miner, then pop() extracts miner - can incorrect vec ordering cause miner/user confusion? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Snapshot Query] SortitionDB::get_block_snapshot_consensus() expects parent_miner.consensus_hash to exist, but panics if None - can this be exploited? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Epoch Query] SortitionDB::get_stacks_epoch() expects an epoch to exist for parent_evaluated_snapshot.block_height, but panics if None - is this guaranteed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [Poison Report] get_poison_microblock_report() returns Option<(StacksAddress, u16)>, but only the address is used - can the sequence number be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: find_mature_miner_rewards()] [User Reward Loop] For each user in users.iter(), calculate_miner_reward is called and parent_reward.total() is asserted to be 0 - can a malicious user bypass this? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: FromRow<MinerPaymentSchedule>] [String Parsing] recipient_str is parsed with PrincipalData::parse() wrapped in expect() - can malformed principal strings cause a panic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: FromRow<MinerReward>] [String Parsing] Same principal parsing issue with expect('FATAL: could not parse recipient principal') - is input validation done before database insertion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: FromRow<MinerPaymentSchedule>] [Default Value] schedule_type defaults to HeaderTypeNames::Epoch2 if column is missing - can this cause incorrect reward calculations in Nakamoto? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: FromRow<MinerPaymentSchedule>] [Type Matching] The match on schedule_type creates different MinerPaymentTxFees variants - can mismatches between schedule_type and actual epoch cause consensus bugs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_poison_microblock_report()] [Height Conversion] Converts height u64 to u32 for db.get_microblock_poison_report() - can overflow/truncation occur for high block heights? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_poison_microblock_report()] [Address Conversion] Converts principal to StacksAddress with .into() - can this fail for contract principals or malformed data? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: poison_microblock_commission()] [Commission Fraction] The commission is POISON_MICROBLOCK_COMMISSION_FRACTION / 100 - is this constant properly validated to be <= 100? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Punishment Application] When poison_reporter_opt is Some but participant.miner is false (user), they get 0 reward - does this properly disincentivize supporting malicious miners? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: MinerReward::genesis()] [Burn Address] Returns a genesis reward with burn_address as recipient - can this be exploited if burn_address is somehow made to receive real rewards? (Medium)"
