  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Genesis Block] If stop_sortition is the genesis block with no parent_sortition_id, what happens at line 240 when trying to load the parent? Does get_block_snapshot() handle this gracefully? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Height Overflow] At line 223, height_bound is a u64 from block_height - if block_height is near u64::MAX, could the comparison at line 236 overflow or behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Hex String Length] The regex at line 88 enforces exactly 40 hex characters - but is ConsensusHash actually 20 bytes (40 hex chars)? If the hash size changes in a future version, would this break? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Catch-All Error] At lines 287-297, any error other than NotInSameFork or NoSuchBlockError is caught and returns HttpServerError - could this hide critical consensus errors that should be handled differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: from_snapshot()] [InvalidChainstateDB] At line 157, InvalidChainstateDB is returned when epoch lookup fails - does this error correctly propagate up to the caller, or could it be swallowed by the catch-all handler? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Context] The error message at lines 289-292 includes start_sortition and stop_sortition in debug format - could this leak sensitive information about the node's view of the chain? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Fork Consistency] If two nodes have the same start and stop sortitions but different stacks_tip values (line 232), could from_snapshot() return different first_block_mined values, causing them to disagree on fork info? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Deterministic Ordering] The results are built by traversing parent_sortition_id links - is this traversal deterministic across all nodes, or could database indexing differences cause different ordering? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Struct: TenureForkingInfo] [Serialization Determinism] With prefix_hex and prefix_opt_hex serializers at lines 45, 52, 55, 61, 67, is the JSON serialization order deterministic? Could different serde versions produce different JSON representations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: from_snapshot()] [Conditional Block Inclusion] At line 146, blocks are only included if sn.sortition is true - could a malicious miner trigger a sortition without mining blocks, causing the response to indicate sortition occurred but with None blocks, confusing fork analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: from_snapshot()] [Database Query Cost] At line 179, get_nakamoto_blocks_in_tenure() potentially loads many blocks - is this query indexed efficiently, or could an attacker query tenures with many blocks to cause slow DB queries? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Loop Iterations] The loop at line 235 can iterate up to DEPTH_LIMIT (10) times for sortitions plus unlimited shadow blocks - what's the maximum number of DB queries this could make? Could this be DoS'd? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [JSON Serialization] At line 309, HttpResponseContents::try_from_json() serializes potentially large nakamoto_blocks vectors - is there a size limit on the JSON response to prevent OOM? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Parameter Relationship] No validation checks whether start_sortition height is less than stop_sortition height - could a client query from height 100 to height 50, causing the loop logic to behave unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tip Validation] At line 232, network.stacks_tip.block_id() is used without validation - could a node with an uninitialized or corrupted tip cause errors or incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: from_snapshot()] [Epoch Availability] At line 150, get_stacks_epoch() might return None if the epoch is not found - but the ok_or_else at line 150 converts this to InvalidChainstateDB - is this the correct error, or should it be a different error indicating missing epoch data? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Struct: GetTenuresForkInfo] [Field Defaults] The struct derives Default at line 74, setting both sortitions to None - if try_parse_request() is never called, could the handler execute with None values? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Struct: TenureForkingInfo] [Burnchain Binding] At lines 44-48, burn_block_hash and burn_block_height bind the tenure to Bitcoin - if a Bitcoin reorg occurs, could old TenureForkingInfo become invalid? Should there be a warning to clients about reorg risks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Burnchain Consistency] The function doesn't explicitly check that stop_sortition and start_sortition are both anchored to the same burnchain fork - could a Bitcoin reorg cause them to be on different burnchain forks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: from_snapshot()] [Option Handling] At lines 164-165 and 174-175, map() is used to transform Option<Header> to Option<StacksBlockId> - if the header is Some but index_block_hash() panics or fails, could this cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Clone Operations] At lines 185-189, multiple fields are cloned from the snapshot - if any of these types (BurnchainHeaderHash, SortitionId, ConsensusHash) have expensive clone operations, could this cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/get_tenures_fork_info.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Lifetime Management] At line 98, the Captures reference has a lifetime tied to the regex match - could the captures be invalidated if the regex processing is deferred, causing use-after-free? (Low)"
