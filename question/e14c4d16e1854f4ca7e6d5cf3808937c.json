  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-4.clar] [Function: stack-increase()] [Fold Return Value] The fold at line 1131 returns some or none, but assertion checks is-some; if fold returns none due to stacker mismatch in increase-reward-cycle-entry, does ERR_INVALID_INCREASE reveal the failure point? (Medium)",
