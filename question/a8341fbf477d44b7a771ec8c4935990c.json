  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: add-pox-partial-stacked()] [Sender Context] partial-stacked-by-cycle uses tx-sender as the key - can a malicious contract call this on behalf of multiple users to mix their partial stakes? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: add-pox-partial-stacked()] [Amount Overflow] The fold adds amount-ustx to current-amount in each cycle - can stacking max uint repeatedly cause the stacked-amount to overflow? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: add-pox-partial-stacked()] [Cycle Iteration] The fold iterates cycle-indexes (u0..u11) but checks (>= cycle-index num-cycles) - if num-cycles > 12, does this silently skip cycles beyond index 11? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: add-pox-partial-stacked()] [Map Update] map-set is called even when (>= cycle-index num-cycles) is false - can this create partial entries for cycles beyond the lock period? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: add-pox-partial-stacked-to-ith-cycle()] [Return Value] The function returns a tuple but doesn't indicate success/failure - can errors in map-set be silently ignored? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Caller Permission] The function checks check-caller-allowed but partial-stacked-by-cycle uses tx-sender - can an allowed contract commit another sender's partial stack? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Minimum Not Checked Initially] delegate-stack-stx doesn't check minimum, but inner-stack-aggregation-commit does via can-stack-stx - can partial stakes below minimum be orphaned if never committed? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Single Cycle Commit] The function commits with num-cycles: u1 - does this mean partial stakes are only committed for one cycle even if lock-period is longer? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Stacker None] add-pox-addr-to-ith-reward-cycle is called with stacker: none - does this correctly mark entries as delegator-committed vs direct stacking? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Delete Timing] map-delete partial-stacked-by-cycle happens after adding to reward cycle - if add fails, is the partial stake lost? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: inner-stack-aggregation-commit()] [Index Return] The function returns pox-addr-index from element-at u0 - but what if reward-set-indexes is empty after add-pox-addr-to-ith-reward-cycle? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-commit()] [Return Type Mismatch] The legacy wrapper returns (ok true) but inner-stack-aggregation-commit returns an index - is this incompatibility intentional? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-commit-indexed()] [Index Reuse] Does the returned index remain valid if other stackers are added/removed from the same reward cycle? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Future Cycle Check] The check (> reward-cycle (current-pox-reward-cycle)) at line 763 - can calling this at the cycle boundary cause off-by-one errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Existing Entry Check] The function unwraps existing-entry from reward-cycle-pox-address-list - if the entry was deleted by fold-unlock, does this cause a panic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Stacker None Check] The assertion (is-none (get stacker existing-entry)) at line 784 - can this be bypassed if stacker is (some principal) but that principal's lock has expired? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Address Mismatch] The check (is-eq pox-addr (get pox-addr existing-entry)) at line 788 - can address version mismatches (e.g., 0x04 vs 0x02) pass equality but represent different Bitcoin addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Total Overflow] The calculation (+ (get total-ustx existing-entry) amount-ustx) at line 773 - can this overflow if existing entry is near max uint? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/pox-2.clar] [Function: stack-aggregation-increase()] [Minimum Re-check] After increasing, the check (<= (get-stacking-minimum) total-ustx) at line 780 - but if liquid supply increased, can the new total still be below the updated minimum? (Medium)"
