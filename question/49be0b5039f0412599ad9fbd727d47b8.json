  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [MAX_VEC_SIZE] Does user_agent String deserialization respect the MAX_VEC_SIZE limit (64MB) defined in encodable.rs, and if so, can an attacker still cause memory pressure by sending user_agent strings just under this limit? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Struct: VersionMessage] [Serialization Size] What is the maximum possible serialized size of a VersionMessage (considering max user_agent length), and could an attacker exceed protocol-level message size limits by crafting a maximum-size VersionMessage? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Clock Skew] If timestamp is used to adjust node local time or validate message timing, can an attacker send many VersionMessages with skewed timestamps to gradually shift the node's time offset, affecting time-sensitive protocol operations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Eclipse Attack] Can an attacker controlling all incoming connections send coordinated timestamps to isolate a node's time perception from the network, enabling eclipse attacks that rely on time-based validation? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Struct: VersionMessage] [Hash Collision] If VersionMessage serialization is used in any hashing or signature operations, can an attacker craft two different VersionMessages that serialize to the same bytes due to padding, encoding ambiguity, or field ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [Normalization] Are user_agent strings normalized (e.g., Unicode normalization, whitespace trimming) before comparison, and if not, can an attacker send visually identical but byte-different strings to bypass deduplication or filtering? (Low)"
