  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Conditional Compilation] What happens if a target platform is neither Unix nor Windows (e.g., WASM, embedded systems, or unsupported architectures)? Does the module fail to compile with a clear error, or could it compile with no signal handling implementation, potentially causing the node to ignore shutdown signals and remain running when it should terminate? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Conditional Compilation] Could both #[cfg(unix)] and #[cfg(windows)] conditions evaluate to true simultaneously in cross-compilation or misconfigured build environments, causing conflicting module definitions and symbol collisions from the wildcard re-exports (pub use self::unix::* and pub use self::windows::*)? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Re-export Safety] The wildcard re-exports (pub use self::unix::* and pub use self::windows::*) expose all public symbols from the platform modules. If the unix and windows modules export different symbol sets or incompatible type signatures, could this lead to compilation failures on one platform but not another, breaking platform portability and potentially allowing platform-specific vulnerabilities to go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Missing Platform Support] On unsupported platforms where neither cfg(unix) nor cfg(windows) is true, does the absence of the init_os_handler() and block_ctrl_c() exports cause a compile-time error, or could downstream code that unconditionally calls these functions compile but exhibit undefined behavior at runtime? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Symbol Namespace] Since the file uses wildcard re-exports (pub use self::unix::* and pub use self::windows::*), if future changes to the unix or windows modules inadvertently export symbols with identical names but different semantics, could this cause silent breakage or security-relevant behavior changes without compiler warnings? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Platform Detection] If the Rust compiler's platform detection (cfg(unix) and cfg(windows)) is incorrect or spoofed during cross-compilation, could the wrong platform implementation be selected, potentially causing signal handlers to fail silently or behave incorrectly during node shutdown, leading to incomplete chainstate commits? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/platform/mod.rs] [Conditional Compilation] Are there any Unix-like platforms (e.g., certain BSDs, Solaris, or custom embedded systems) that might not set cfg(unix) but still require Unix-style signal handling? Could such platforms incorrectly fall through to having no implementation, causing the Stacks node to fail at signal registration? (Medium)"
