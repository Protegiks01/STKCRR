  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: update_account_nonce()] [Atomicity] Is the db.set_account_nonce call atomic with respect to other account operations, or can interleaving cause nonce/balance inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_nonce()] [Reorg Safety] During chain reorganization, if an account's nonce is queried while the chain state is being rewound, can stale nonce values be returned? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Reward Theft] If a malicious miner sets participant.miner to false while being the actual miner, can they bypass punishment for poison microblocks while still collecting fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Burn Manipulation] Can a miner collude with users to manipulate this_burn_total and other_burn_total ratios to receive a disproportionate coinbase share? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Poison Microblock Bypass] When poison_reporter_opt is Some and participant.miner is true, the reporter gets poison_microblock_commission - but can the miner manipulate reporter_address to redirect rewards to themselves? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Fee Distribution] When a miner is punished (punished = true), anchored fees and confirmed streamed fees go to 0, but parent still gets produced fees - can this be gamed to extract value by intentionally getting punished? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [User Burn Support] If participant is a user who helped a punished miner, they get 0 reward - but can users avoid this by quickly switching their burn support before punishment is applied? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Epoch2 vs Nakamoto] The parent_streamed_fees calculation has special logic for pre-Epoch21 that's 'wrong per #3140' - can this discrepancy be exploited to cause consensus splits between nodes on different epochs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: calculate_miner_reward()] [Nakamoto Fees] In Nakamoto mode, tx fees correspond to parent tenure fees with (0, parent_fees, 0) - can this be manipulated to avoid fee payments or double-claim fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: MinerReward::try_add_parent()] [Reward Merging] If self.is_child() returns false due to corrupted state but other.is_parent() is true, None is returned - can this cause valid parent rewards to be silently dropped? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: MinerReward::try_add_parent()] [Reward Merging] The merged reward takes tx_fees_streamed_produced from 'other' (parent) but what if other.tx_fees_streamed_produced is maliciously inflated? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: MinerReward::is_child()] [Classification Logic] The check 'coinbase > 0 && tx_fees_streamed_produced == 0' may misclassify rewards if a child legitimately has produced fees - is this possible? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: MinerReward::is_parent()] [Classification Logic] Checking only 'coinbase == 0' to identify parents - can an attacker craft a reward with coinbase=0 but non-zero fees to confuse the logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: inner_insert_matured_miner_reward()] [Duplicate Detection] The duplicate check uses assert_eq! to enforce single parent/child insertion, but can different Stacks forks race to insert incompatible rewards for the same block IDs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: inner_insert_matured_miner_reward()] [Assertion Failure] If rw != reward due to any discrepancy, the assert_eq! panics with 'FATAL: tried to insert multiple distinct matured parent block reward records' - can this be triggered to DOS nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_matured_parent_miner_reward()] [Validation] Asserts parent_reward.is_parent() and vtxindex == 0, but what if these are bypassed by corrupted database state before the call? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_matured_child_miner_reward()] [Validation] Similar assertion checks for child rewards - can malicious block construction satisfy is_child() while violating vtxindex == 0? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_matured_child_user_reward()] [Validation] For user rewards, vtxindex > 0 is asserted, but can vtxindex be manipulated to be 0 to masquerade as miner rewards? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: inner_insert_matured_miner_reward()] [Race Condition] Between the inner_get_matured_miner_payments() query and the INSERT, can another thread insert the same reward, causing the duplicate check to fail? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: inner_insert_matured_miner_reward()] [SQL Injection] The INSERT statement uses parameterized queries, but are parent_index_block_hash and child_index_block_hash properly validated before insertion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_miner_payment_schedule()] [Bounds Validation] Asserts burnchain values < i64::MAX before u64_to_sql conversion - but what if u64_to_sql fails or the database accepts out-of-range values? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_miner_payment_schedule()] [SQL Injection] The function uses params! with user-controlled address, recipient, and hash values - are these properly sanitized? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: insert_miner_payment_schedule()] [String Conversion] Coinbase and tx_fees are converted to strings via .to_string() - can extremely large u128 values cause parsing issues when reading back? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_scheduled_block_rewards_at_block()] [SQL Query] The ORDER BY vtxindex ASC clause - can vtxindex values be manipulated to reorder rewards and change who gets paid first? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/accounts.rs] [Function: get_scheduled_block_rewards_in_fork_at_height()] [Fork Validation] If get_tip_ancestor returns None, an empty vec is returned - can this hide missing rewards during fork switches? (High)"
