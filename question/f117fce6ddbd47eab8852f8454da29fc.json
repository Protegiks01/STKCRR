  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Sponsor Clone vs Take] The sponsor is cloned at line 203 instead of taken - why the inconsistency, and could this lead to the sponsor being used multiple times in unexpected ways? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Response Validation] The response parsing at lines 311-318 uses `parse_json` - is there validation that the response structure matches expectations, or could a malicious server return unexpected data? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [JSON Parsing Errors] What happens if the response JSON is malformed or contains unexpected fields - could this cause the client to crash or misinterpret the response? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new_fastcallreadonlyfunction()] [Missing Authentication] The client request constructor at lines 322-350 doesn't include any authentication header - is this intentional, and does it mean clients must add authentication separately? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new_fastcallreadonlyfunction()] [Argument Serialization] Function arguments are serialized using `v.to_string()` at line 344 - is this guaranteed to produce valid hex-encoded Clarity values that can be deserialized by the server? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new_fastcallreadonlyfunction()] [Infallible Unwrap] The function uses `.expect(",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new_fastcallreadonlyfunction()] [URL Construction Safety] The URL is constructed using format! at lines 336-339 - could special characters in the contract_addr, contract_name, or function_name cause URL injection or parsing issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [RPCFastCallReadOnlyRequestHandler struct] [Cost Model Bypass] The entire premise of this endpoint is to bypass normal cost tracking using `new_free()` - could this architectural decision enable a whole class of DoS attacks that would normally be prevented by cost limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [RPCFastCallReadOnlyRequestHandler struct] [Authentication Strength] The authentication mechanism uses a simple password comparison - should this endpoint use stronger authentication (e.g., signed requests, JWT, mTLS) given it bypasses cost tracking? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Read-Only Invariant] The core security assumption is that setting `read_only = false` but checking `write_count > 0` prevents state mutation - is this assumption sound across all Clarity operations, including edge cases like events, logs, or temporary state? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Execution Context Isolation] Does the execution environment properly isolate this fast-call from other concurrent operations, or could it interfere with mempool processing, block validation, or other critical node operations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [API Versioning] This endpoint is at `/v3/contracts/fast-call-read/...` - are there v1 or v2 versions with different security properties, and could version confusion lead to calling the wrong endpoint? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [RPCFastCallReadOnlyRequestHandler struct] [Shared State with callreadonly] The handler wraps `RPCCallReadOnlyRequestHandler` - could state corruption or race conditions in the shared handler affect both endpoints? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Node State Locking] The `node.with_node_state()` call at line 212 presumably takes locks - could this endpoint be used to hold locks for extended periods (up to max_execution_time), blocking other critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Chainstate Consistency] The execution reads from chainstate without any explicit transaction or snapshot marker - what guarantees consistency if chainstate is being modified by concurrent block processing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Contract-Call Chains] The comment mentions that `read_only = false` allows contract-call? even to other read-only functions - could a chain of contract-call? operations amplify execution cost beyond what a single time limit can contain? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Trait Implementations] Could calling a trait function through this endpoint bypass checks that would normally apply to direct contract calls, leading to unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Dynamic Dispatch] If the contract uses dynamic dispatch or runtime type checking, could the lack of cost tracking allow expensive type resolution operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Fork Consistency] If executed during a chain reorganization or fork, could this endpoint return results based on an orphaned or invalid chain tip? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Epoch Boundaries] Could calling this endpoint during an epoch transition lead to execution under wrong consensus rules or with incorrect cost models? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new()] [Maximum Argument Size] The `maximum_call_argument_size` parameter is passed through from the regular call-read-only handler - is this limit appropriate given that cost tracking is disabled, or should it be more restrictive? (Medium)"
