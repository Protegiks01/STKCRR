  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Version Compatibility] If these macros are used to serialize data in one version of stacks-core and deserialize in another, could changes in the underlying Read/Write implementations break backward compatibility? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Constant Evaluation] Is this macro always evaluated at compile-time when $bitvec is a constant, or could runtime evaluation introduce performance vulnerabilities where expensive calculations block consensus-critical paths? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Sign Extension] When deserializing signed integers, does from_be_bytes correctly sign-extend the bytes, or could incorrect sign handling cause positive/negative value confusion in consensus logic? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Size Validation] Does from_bytes validate that the input buffer is exactly $len bytes, or could it accept shorter/longer buffers and silently truncate or pad, causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Expression Safety] If $bitvec is a complex expression with side effects, could those side effects execute multiple times due to macro expansion, causing unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [All Macros] [Panic Safety] Are there any code paths in these macros where a panic could leave shared state in an inconsistent condition, causing consensus divergence after a node restarts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_stacks_message_codec_for_int!] [Buffer Management] If the same Write or Read stream is used for multiple serialize/deserialize operations, could buffering behavior cause the operations to interfere with each other? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [impl_byte_array_message_codec!] [Error Messages] The expect message 'BUG: buffer is not the right size' suggests this should never happen - if it does, would the panic crash the node during block validation, creating a DoS vector? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/codec/macros.rs] [BITVEC_LEN!] [Underflow] Could ($bitvec) / 8 + 1 underflow if $bitvec is a signed type with a negative value, causing the macro to return a garbage length? (Medium)"
