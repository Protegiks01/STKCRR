  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash()] [TupleData Panic] The expect() on TupleData::from_data() can panic - what conditions in the pox-addr, reward-cycle, period, topic, auth-id, or max-amount fields would trigger this? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash()] [Field Order Dependency] Does the specific order of fields in the tuple (pox-addr, reward-cycle, period, topic, auth-id, max-amount) matter for security, or could reordering create valid signatures for unauthorized operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash()] [Chain ID Substitution] Can an attacker generate a valid signature for chain_id = MAINNET and replay it on TESTNET (or vice versa) by manipulating the domain tuple? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash()] [Missing Signer Key Field] The message hash doesn't include the signer's public key itself - could this allow a signature generated by signer A to be used to authorize operations for signer B if other parameters match? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signed_data_domain()] [Version Hardcoding] The function hardcodes version '1.0.0' - if a future PoX-5 reuses similar logic, could old PoX-4 signatures be replayed, or is the domain name 'pox-4-signer' sufficient separation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_signature()] [Signature Error Handling] What conditions cause signer_key.sign() to return Err, and could an attacker repeatedly trigger these errors to DoS the signing service or leak information about private key state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Function: pox4::make_pox_4_signer_key_signature()] [Parameter Passthrough] All parameters are passed through to make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash() - are there any validation or sanitization steps missing that could allow invalid values to reach the hash function? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Enum: Pox4SignatureTopic] [Missing Topic] The Into<Pox4SignatureTopic> implementation for &'static str panics on invalid topics but doesn't handle 'agg-increase' - is this intentional, and could it cause runtime panics when processing AggregationIncrease signatures? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Enum: Pox4SignatureTopic] [Topic String Mismatch] Each variant has an associated string ('stack-stx', 'agg-commit', etc.) - can these strings be controlled by user input, and if so, could case sensitivity or whitespace differences bypass topic validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Enum: Pox4SignatureTopic] [Panic on Invalid Input] The Into trait panics with 'Invalid pox-4 signature topic' - should this return a Result instead to prevent node crashes when parsing untrusted topic strings from network messages? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Enum: Pox4SignatureTopic] [Topic Replay] Can a signature generated with topic='stack-stx' be reused for topic='stack-extend' if the attacker can manipulate the topic field, potentially authorizing unintended operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cross-Function] [Signature Replay Across Topics] Can an attacker generate one signature with make_pox_4_signer_key_signature() for StackStx and replay it for AggregationCommit by changing only the topic parameter while keeping other fields identical? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cross-Function] [Domain Confusion] If both generic sign_structured_data() and PoX-4 specific signing are used in the same codebase, could there be domain confusion where a generic signature is accepted as a PoX-4 signature or vice versa? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cross-Function] [Inconsistent Validation] Are there any cases where make_pox_4_signer_key_message_hash() accepts parameter combinations that would be rejected by the actual PoX-4 contract validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Cross-Function] [Hash Function Consistency] Both structured_data_hash() and structured_data_message_hash() use Sha256Sum::from_data() - is SHA256 the consensus-mandated hash function, or could a future upgrade introduce algorithm confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Constant: STRUCTURED_DATA_PREFIX] [Prefix Collision] The prefix [0x53, 0x49, 0x50, 0x30, 0x31, 0x38] ('SIP018') is fixed - could this collide with prefixes used in other Stacks signing contexts like transaction signing or block signing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Constant: STRUCTURED_DATA_PREFIX] [Prefix Length] Is 6 bytes sufficient to prevent accidental collisions with other message signing schemes that might use similar prefixes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [Constant: STRUCTURED_DATA_PREFIX] [Future SIP Collision] If a future SIP019, SIP020, etc. uses similar prefix patterns, could there be confusion or replay attacks between different SIP signing contexts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [General] [Value Serialization Determinism] Does Clarity's Value.serialize_write() guarantee deterministic byte output for all value types (tuples, lists, strings, etc.), or could non-determinism cause signature validation inconsistencies across nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [General] [Buffer Size Attacks] When serializing arbitrary Clarity values, are there size limits to prevent attackers from creating extremely large serialized payloads that exhaust memory during hashing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [General] [Nested Structure Limits] Can deeply nested tuples or lists within structured_data or domain values cause stack overflow during recursive serialization? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [pox4 module] [Reward Cycle Time Travel] Can an attacker pre-generate signatures for future reward cycles with extremely large reward_cycle values, then replay them years later to bypass time-based authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [pox4 module] [Zero Value Attacks] Are signatures with reward_cycle=0, period=0, or auth_id=0 properly handled, or could zero values create edge cases in validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/util_lib/signed_structured_data.rs] [pox4 module] [Max Amount Bypass] If max_amount is set to u128::MAX in the signature but the actual PoX-4 contract has lower limits, could this create authorization bypass scenarios? (High)",
