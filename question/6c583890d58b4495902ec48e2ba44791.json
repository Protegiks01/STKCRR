  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Lifetime Safety] Do the returned Contract and Value lifetimes correctly prevent callers from holding these objects after clarity_tx is moved or dropped, or could this cause use-after-free? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Reentrancy] If clarity_tx represents a nested transaction and get_contract() or get_data_var() is called recursively (e.g., during contract execution), can this cause transaction nesting overflow or rollback stack corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract()] [Missing Validation] Does get_contract() verify that the contract is valid for the current epoch before returning it, or could it return contracts that violate epoch-specific Clarity rules? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Missing Validation] Does get_data_var() check whether the variable is marked as private/public, or can it expose private variables that should only be accessible within the contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Null Handling] Can contract_id or data_var contain empty strings or null-equivalent values that cause database key construction to fail or overlap with system keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Error Recovery] If with_clarity_db_readonly panics during execution (e.g., out of memory), is the rollback still guaranteed to execute, or could this leave the database in an inconsistent state? (High)"
