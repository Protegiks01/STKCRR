  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [All Structs] [Deterministic Serialization] Can any of the derived Serialize implementations produce non-deterministic byte sequences (e.g., due to HashMap ordering or uninitialized padding), causing consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Opcode-Data Mismatch] Can the opcode field indicate one type of burnchain operation while the data field contains incompatible data, bypassing validation checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Data Field Parsing] If the data field is expected to encode specific Stacks operations, can malformed data cause parser errors that differ across node implementations? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Opcode Overflow] Can the opcode (u8) be interpreted as a signed integer in some contexts, causing opcode values 128-255 to be misinterpreted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinNetworkType + BitcoinTransaction] [Cross-Network Validation] If a BitcoinTransaction is valid on one network type but invalid on another, can nodes disagree on block validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinNetworkType + BitcoinBlock] [Network Mismatch] Can a BitcoinBlock contain transactions that reference outputs from a different network type, enabling cross-network fund theft? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxOutput + BitcoinTransaction] [Total Output Overflow] When summing all BitcoinTxOutput.units values plus data_amt, can the total overflow u64, causing incorrect fee calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Block Height Underflow] Can block_height underflow if it's decremented incorrectly during chain reorganization, causing height wrapping to u64::MAX? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [vtxindex Wraparound] Can vtxindex (u32) wrap around in blocks with more than 2^32 transactions, though this is practically impossible in Bitcoin? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxInputStructured vs Raw] [Fork Risk] Can the transition from Structured (2.05) to Raw (2.1+) inputs cause a hard fork if old and new nodes disagree on input validity? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxInput] [Downgrade Attack] Can a 2.1+ node downgrade to 2.05 and accept previously rejected inputs by parsing them as Structured instead of Raw? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinBlock] [Memory Exhaustion] Can an attacker craft a BitcoinBlock with an enormous txs vector that exhausts node memory during deserialization? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTransaction] [Vector Allocation] Can the inputs or outputs vectors trigger excessive memory allocation during deserialization, enabling memory exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [BitcoinTxInputRaw] [Nested Vector DoS] Can the witness field's Vec<Vec<u8>> structure be exploited with deeply nested or numerous vectors to cause memory or CPU exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Error] [InvalidPoW Handling] If Error::InvalidPoW is returned for a Bitcoin block, can nodes disagree on whether this error is recoverable or requires rejecting the entire block? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Error] [NoncontiguousHeader] Can Error::NoncontiguousHeader be triggered maliciously to cause nodes to reject valid reorganizations or accept invalid ones? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/bitcoin/mod.rs] [Error] [BlockchainHeight Error] Does Error::BlockchainHeight at lines 84 and 110 correctly prevent synchronization beyond the chain tip, or can it be bypassed with crafted height values? (Medium)"
