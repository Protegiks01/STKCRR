  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/mod.rs] [Function: set_handler()] [Windows Compatibility] The documentation at lines 51-52 notes Windows allows multiple handlers called in reverse order - if the node runs on Windows and another component also registers a handler, could signals be handled twice or in unexpected order, causing confusion in shutdown logic? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/mod.rs] [Function: set_handler()] [Thread Configuration] The thread spawned at line 86 uses default stack size and priority - if the user_handler performs complex operations (e.g., coordinating consensus state), could insufficient stack size cause stack overflow, or could priority inversion delay signal handling? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/mod.rs] [Function: set_handler()] [Thread Naming] The thread is named 'signal-handler' at line 87 - if multiple Stacks nodes run in the same process (e.g., for testing), will thread name collisions cause confusion in debugging or monitoring tools? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/ctrlc/mod.rs] [Function: set_handler()] [Ownership Transfer] The 'move' keyword at line 88 transfers ownership of user_handler to the spawned thread - if the caller expects to reuse or inspect the handler after calling set_handler, could this cause confusion or require awkward patterns like Arc<Mutex<F>>? (Low)"
