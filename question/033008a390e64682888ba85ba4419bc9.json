  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does the error message 'Failed to load block header: {:?}' reveal internal ChainError details that could aid attackers in fingerprinting node state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Information Disclosure] When serde_json serialization fails, does the error message expose sensitive header field values or memory addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Information Disclosure] Does HttpNotFound::new(format!('No such block {:?}', &tip)) leak the full StacksBlockId which could reveal chain analysis information? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Monitoring] Does using a static identifier '/v2/headers/:height' prevent proper per-request metrics that could detect DoS patterns based on quantity values? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [HTTP Compliance] If get_content_length() returns a non-zero value, is the body properly consumed and discarded to prevent HTTP request smuggling? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Protocol Violation] Could an attacker send a chunked transfer encoding with content-length 0 to bypass the body validation check? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Input Processing] Is the query string passed to HttpRequestContents::query_string() properly validated, or could it contain tip specifications that override the default behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Injection] Could query string parameters be used to inject additional commands or alter the tip selection logic in load_stacks_chain_tip()? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Protocol Violation] If an error occurs after the opening '[' is sent but before all headers are transmitted, will clients receive malformed JSON? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Stream Integrity] Is there any mechanism to detect if the stream was interrupted mid-transmission, allowing clients to request retransmission? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [TOCTOU] Between reading each header in the parent chain walk, could concurrent chain reorganizations cause the stream to serve inconsistent snapshots? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: StacksHeaderStream::new()] [Database Isolation] Does reopen_db() create a new connection with a snapshot isolation level, or could other transactions affect the headers being streamed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Chain Consistency] When following parent_block_id links, is there validation that each parent's height is exactly one less than its child's height? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Consensus Safety] Could a maliciously crafted block with a parent_block_id pointing to a future block cause the stream to traverse forward instead of backward? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Loop Termination] Is there a maximum iteration count to prevent infinite loops if the parent chain contains cycles due to database corruption? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: generate_next_chunk()] [Type Safety] When casting header_bytes.len() to u64 for total_bytes accumulation, could extremely large headers cause the cast to overflow on 32-bit platforms? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: StacksHeaderStream::new()] [Type Safety] Is the conversion from header_info.height (u64) to num_headers (u32) properly saturating, or does it silently truncate? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Struct: RPCHeadersRequestHandler] [Memory Safety] Does the Clone implementation for RPCHeadersRequestHandler properly deep-copy all state, or could shared state cause aliasing bugs? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: StacksHeaderStream::new()] [Memory Safety] When cloning index_block_hash via tip.clone(), is this a deep copy or could modifications affect the original tip reference? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Function: verb()] [Protocol Safety] Does the HTTP layer enforce that only GET requests match this handler, or could POST/PUT requests with the same path be accepted? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Struct: StacksHeaderStream] [State Management] Is the offset field actually used in the current implementation, and if not, could removing it cause issues if future code depends on it? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getheaders.rs] [Struct: StacksHeaderStream] [Consistency] Does offset accurately track the position in the stream, or could it become desynchronized from total_bytes in error conditions? (Low)"
