  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Fork Selection] If multiple competing chain tips exist during a fork, can the tip selection be manipulated to return balances from a non-canonical chain? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Default Balance] When an account doesn't exist and STXBalance::zero() is returned, does this correctly represent 'never existed' vs. 'existed but has zero balance' for nonce validation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Default Nonce] When nonce defaults to 0 for non-existent accounts, can this allow transaction submission for accounts that should reject all transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Boundary Condition] At exactly burn_block_height == unlock_height, are tokens considered locked or unlocked, and is this consistent with transaction validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Zero Balance] When balance is exactly zero but there's a nonce > 0, does the API correctly distinguish this from a never-used account? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Max Values] When balance or locked amounts are at u128::MAX, does the hex encoding and serialization handle these boundary values without overflow? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Struct: AccountEntryResponse] [Serialization] Can the optional balance_proof and nonce_proof fields be set to Some(",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Struct: AccountEntryResponse] [Type Safety] Are balance and locked stored as Strings instead of numeric types to prevent JSON number precision loss, and could this cause parsing ambiguities? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Struct: AccountEntryResponse] [Invariant Validation] Does any validation ensure that unlock_height is greater than current burn height when locked > 0, preventing logically inconsistent responses? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consistency] If get_current_burnchain_block_height() returns a different height than what sortdb.index_handle_at_block() uses, can balance calculations become inconsistent? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Version] Are the v1/v2/v3 unlock heights all retrieved from the same consistent database snapshot, or can they reflect different points in time? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Version Compatibility] If a client queries an account during a PoX version transition, can the unlock_height returned correspond to the wrong PoX version's rules? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Future Versions] If PoX v4 or later versions are introduced, will the code fail gracefully or return incorrect unlock heights for accounts locked under newer versions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Recovery] If any of the get_v*_unlock_height() calls fail with Ok() returning errors converted to None, does this silently degrade functionality instead of failing safely? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Partial Failure] If balance retrieval succeeds but nonce retrieval fails within the same clarity_tx, can this lead to returning inconsistent account state? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getaccount.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Parameter Parsing] When contents.get_with_proof() is called, how does it parse the 'proof' query parameter, and can malformed values cause unexpected behavior? (Low)"
