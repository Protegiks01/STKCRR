  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-signer-weight()] [Identity Spoofing] Does the check `(is-eq (get signer details) tx-sender)` prevent a malicious actor from using another signer's index to vote with that signer's weight? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Weight Manipulation] Can the signer-weight value be manipulated between retrieval and use if the .signers contract state changes mid-execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-signer-weight()] [Index Bounds] What prevents an attacker from providing an out-of-bounds signer-index that might cause unexpected behavior in the .signers contract? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Zero Weight] If a signer has zero weight, can they still vote and potentially reach the vote-count threshold even if vote-weight threshold isn't met? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-and-cache-total-weight()] [Weight Staleness] Once cached in cycle-total-weight, is the total weight ever updated if signers are added/removed mid-cycle, and can this cause incorrect threshold calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Key Length] Does the check `(is-eq (len key) u33)` ensure the key is a valid compressed secp256k1 public key, or can malformed 33-byte values be approved? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Key Format] Beyond length checking, is there validation that the key starts with 0x02 or 0x03 (compressed format markers) or can any 33-byte buff be used? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [All-Zero Key] Can an all-zero 33-byte buffer be voted for and approved as an aggregate public key, potentially breaking signing operations? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Invalid Point] Can an aggregate public key that isn't a valid point on the secp256k1 curve be approved, causing signature verification failures? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Tally Consistency] If votes map insertion succeeds but tally map-set fails (theoretical), can this create inconsistency between recorded votes and tallied weights? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Round-Data Sync] Are the votes map, tally map, and round-data map always kept in sync, or can transaction failures create inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Approval Race] When map-insert for aggregate-public-keys is called, if multiple votes reach threshold in the same block, does only the first succeed and others gracefully fail? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Partial State] If aggregate-public-keys map-insert fails (returns false), are the votes, tally, round-data, and used-aggregate-public-keys maps left in an inconsistent state? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Contract Call Failure] If contract-call to .signers get-signer-by-index fails with an error, does the try! properly propagate the error and prevent partial vote recording? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-and-cache-total-weight()] [Signers List Corruption] If .signers get-signers returns an empty list or malformed data, can this cause division by zero or incorrect threshold calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: is-in-voting-window()] [Dependency Risk] The unwrap-panic on .signers get-last-set-cycle will halt execution if it fails - is this acceptable behavior or could it lock voting? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Top-level] [POX Info] The pox-info is fetched with unwrap-panic at contract deployment - if .pox-4 get-pox-info fails, will this prevent the contract from deploying? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Vote Spam] Can a malicious signer vote for many different aggregate public keys in different rounds to bloat the votes, tally, and round-data maps? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-and-cache-total-weight()] [Fold DoS] If the signers list is extremely large, can the fold operation exceed execution cost limits, preventing votes from being cast? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Storage DoS] Can an attacker create entries in multiple maps (votes, tally, round-data, used-aggregate-public-keys) for many keys to exhaust contract storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Error Precedence] If multiple error conditions are true (duplicate vote AND invalid key length), which error is returned and does this leak information about contract state? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-signer-weight()] [Error Unwrap] The double unwrap pattern `(unwrap! (try! ...))` - if the inner try! fails, does the outer unwrap! properly handle the error or cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: vote-for-aggregate-public-key()] [Silent Failure] When map-insert for aggregate-public-keys returns false (key already exists), the function returns (ok true) - does this hide important state to the caller? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-candidate-info()] [Information Leak] Does returning both candidate-weight and total-weight allow attackers to calculate exact voting progress and time their attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/signers-voting.clar] [Function: get-signer-weight()] [Access Control] This read-only function checks tx-sender, but can it be called in a read-only context where tx-sender might be undefined or spoofed? (Medium)"
