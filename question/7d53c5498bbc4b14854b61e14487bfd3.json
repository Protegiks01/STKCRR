  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_read_count_extend()] [Threshold Configuration] If config.miner.read_count_extend_cost_threshold is set to 0, does this disable read count extends, or cause all blocks to extend? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_read_count_extend()] [Coordinator Timestamp] get_read_count_extend_timestamp() is called on the coordinator - can stale coordinator state cause premature or delayed read count extends? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp()] [Parent Header Lookup] If x.header.parent_block_id doesn't exist when queried, ParentNotFound is returned - but can the parent be added later, causing repeated validation failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp()] [Chainstate Panic] The function uses expect('FATAL: could not open chainstate DB') - can database corruption cause validator nodes to crash when checking block timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp_info()] [Epoch2 Parent Timestamp] For Epoch2 parents, burn_header_timestamp is used - can burn block timestamp manipulation affect Nakamoto block timestamp validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp_info()] [Saturating Subtraction] current_timestamp_secs.saturating_sub(parent_timestamp) prevents underflow - but can negative time deltas (clock skew) cause blocks to be incorrectly accepted? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp_info()] [Millisecond Conversion] time_since_parent_ms multiplies by 1000 - can this multiplication overflow for very large timestamp differences, causing incorrect validation? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: validate_timestamp_info()] [Min Time Configuration] config.miner.min_time_between_blocks_ms determines the minimum gap - can setting this to 0 allow rapid block production that exceeds signer capacity? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: check_burn_tip_changed()] [DB Connection Error] get_canonical_burn_chain_tip() uses expect('FATAL') - can transient DB errors cause the miner to crash instead of retrying? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: check_burn_tip_changed()] [Consensus Hash Comparison] cur_burn_chain_tip.consensus_hash != self.burn_tip_at_start is checked - but can hash collisions cause false positives, aborting valid mining? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: check_burn_tip_changed()] [Missed Tenure Counter] globals.counters.bump_missed_tenures() is called on tip change - but is this counter also incremented when the miner legitimately extends a tenure? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: check_burn_tip_changed()] [Burn Tip at Start Staleness] burn_tip_at_start is set at thread creation but never updated - can long-running tenures accumulate many burn tip changes, causing frequent restarts? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_block()] [Mock Mining Bypass] If mock_mining is true, an empty Vec is returned for signatures - can this empty signature list be incorrectly accepted by validators? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_block()] [Chainstate Open Failure] If open_chainstate_with_faults() fails, the error is wrapped but the proposal continues - can this cause invalid proposals to be sent to signers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_block()] [Coordinator Propose Race] coordinator.propose_block() may timeout or fail - but is new_block mutated during this call, potentially invalidating the miner signature? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: propose_block()] [MinerDB Usage] The miner_db is passed to coordinator.propose_block() - can concurrent miner threads corrupt this database with conflicting proposals? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Mock Mining Skip] If mock_mining is true, broadcasting is skipped - but does the miner still update last_block_mined, causing state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Mining Key Check] mining_key.is_none() is checked twice - can the key become None between checks, causing the miner to panic or broadcast invalid blocks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [P2P Broadcast Failure] broadcast_p2p() errors are mapped to AcceptFailure, but does this properly distinguish between network errors and block rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [StackerDB Message Failure] SignerCoordinator::send_miners_message() can fail with StackerDBUploadError - but is the block already accepted locally, causing divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast()] [Burn Election Block Hash] The consensus_hash used for the BlockPushed message comes from burn_election_block - can this mismatch with the actual block's consensus hash? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast_p2p()] [Block Already Accepted] If the block is not accepted (!accepted), the function logs and returns Ok(()) - but does this prevent double-broadcast attempts or retry logic? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast_p2p()] [Parent Block Info Lookup] get_block_header() for parent_block_id can return NoSuchBlockError - but wasn't this parent just used for mining, indicating a state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast_p2p()] [Burn View Calculation] get_block_burn_view() computes the burn view - can this differ from the miner's burn view, causing accept_block() to reject the miner's own block? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: broadcast_p2p()] [Obtain Method] NakamotoBlockObtainMethod::Mined is used - can this bypass certain validation checks that would apply to network-received blocks? (High)"
