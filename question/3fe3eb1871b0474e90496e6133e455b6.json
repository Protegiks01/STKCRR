  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Macro: newline!] [Newline Variants] Lines 78-91 accept \\\\r\\\\n, \\\\n, but return error otherwise. Could different newline handling between macros cause smuggling? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Macro: check!] [SIMD Validation] Lines 766-783 inline validation checks. Could the macro expansion create subtle bugs if is_header_value_token behavior changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Enum: Error] [Error Granularity] Lines 329-346 define 8 error types. Is this enough granularity to diagnose attacks vs legitimate errors? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Enum: Status] [Partial Handling] Lines 390-426 define Status<T> enum. Could code incorrectly assume Partial means benign incomplete data rather than potential DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Impl: Status::unwrap()] [Panic Safety] Lines 420-425 panic on Partial. Could this be triggered in production if caller doesn't check is_complete() first? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Request Smuggling] Could differences in newline handling (\\\\r\\\\n vs \\\\n accepted in many places) cause this parser to disagree with a proxy about request boundaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Content-Length] This parser doesn't validate Content-Length header. Could conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers cause desynchronization? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Transfer-Encoding] Parser handles chunked encoding but doesn't validate Transfer-Encoding header itself. Could multiple Transfer-Encoding headers cause smuggling? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Header Folding] The parser doesn't implement obsolete header line folding (LWS spanning lines). Could a proxy that does accept folding disagree on header values? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Method Validation] parse_token() accepts any token as method. Are dangerous methods like CONNECT validated elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Header Order] Headers are parsed in order but the order isn't validated. Could sending duplicate headers with different values cause security issues? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Case Sensitivity] Header names are returned as-is without case normalization. Could case-sensitive matching elsewhere cause header bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Partial Reuse] If a Request/Response with Partial status is reused with new data, could old partial state cause issues? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Header Count Limit] TooManyHeaders error requires pre-allocated header array. Could an attacker determine the limit by probing and send exactly limit-1 headers to maximize parsing cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Memory Allocation] The parser requires caller to allocate headers array. Could very large arrays be requested, causing memory exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Parsing Complexity] Header value parsing uses loops with validation checks. Could worst-case input (many whitespace characters) cause O(n^2) behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Overall: Partial Accumulation] If caller accumulates Partial data over multiple calls, could an attacker send data one byte at a time to exhaust resources? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Context: RPC Endpoint] If this parser handles RPC requests for block submission or transaction broadcast, could malformed HTTP cause consensus-critical operations to fail? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Context: P2P Protocol] If HTTP is used for peer communication, could request smuggling allow an attacker to inject fake peer messages? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Context: DoS Protection] Could attackers send malformed requests to trigger expensive parsing paths, preventing legitimate transactions from being processed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Context: Header Injection] If header values from parsed requests are used in Clarity contracts or chainstate, could injection attacks corrupt blockchain state? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Context: Network Partition] Could differences in HTTP parsing between nodes cause network splits where some nodes reject blocks others accept? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Edge Case: Zero-Length] Could zero-length buffers, headers, or values cause divide-by-zero or underflow in length calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Edge Case: Maximum Values] Could usize::MAX be reached in position tracking, causing wrapping even with checked arithmetic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/httparse/mod.rs] [Edge Case: Null Bytes] Do validation functions properly reject null bytes (0x00) in headers, methods, URIs? (Medium)"
