  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_dns_lookups_begin()] [Timestamp Insertion] At line 1742, requested_blocks is updated with now + BLOCK_REREQUEST_INTERVAL - can clock changes cause these timestamps to become invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_dns_lookups_begin()] [Capacity Check] At lines 1839-1845, the loop breaks if at capacity - but can this cause critical blocks to be skipped? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_dns_lookups_begin()] [Pessimistic Advancement] At lines 1848-1865, sortition heights are pessimistically advanced by reward_cycle_length - can this cause large gaps in coverage? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_dns_lookups_begin()] [URL Set Collection] At lines 1879-1895, URLs are collected into a HashSet then Vec - can duplicate URL handling cause issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: begin_request()] [Infinite Loop] The loop at line 1921 continues until requestables is empty or a request succeeds - can malformed URLs cause infinite retries? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: begin_request()] [DNS Lookup Check] At line 1924, dns_lookups.get checks for resolved addresses - can stale or incorrect DNS results be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: begin_request()] [PeerHost Parsing] At lines 1927-1932, PeerHost::try_from_url can return None - but can unparseable URLs that passed earlier validation reach here? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: begin_request()] [Address Iteration] At line 1935, sockaddrs are iterated - if all addresses fail, the requestable is silently dropped - can this cause blocks to be permanently missing? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: begin_request()] [Connection Error Handling] At lines 1949-1955, connection failures are logged but the loop continues - can this cause excessive connection attempts to dead peers? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_getblocks_begin()] [Request Prioritization] At line 1982, requests are prioritized by PeerNetwork::prioritize_requests - can this prioritization cause consensus-critical blocks to be delayed? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_getblocks_begin()] [Missing Sortition Height] At lines 1993-1998, if a sortition height has no blocks, it's logged but no error is returned - can this cause silent failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: block_getmicroblocks_begin()] [Microblock Prioritization] Similar to blocks at line 2019, microblocks are prioritized - can this cause confirmed microblock streams to be delayed in favor of newer ones? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: prioritize_requests()] [Rarest-First Prioritization] At lines 1563-1570, blocks with fewer available peers are prioritized - can this be gamed by attackers who claim to have rare blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: finish_downloads()] [Microblock Reversal] At line 2107, microblocks are reversed because they're served in reverse order - can incorrect reversal cause stream validation to fail? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: finish_downloads()] [Missing Block Header] At lines 2109-2127, if a block header is missing, the microblock stream is dropped - can PoX reorgs cause valid microblocks to be lost? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: finish_downloads()] [Parent Assertion] At lines 2129-2133, an assert checks that parent_block_header is Some - can this panic if request construction had errors? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: finish_downloads()] [Stream Validation] At lines 2137-2166, validate_parent_microblock_stream is called - can invalid streams be accepted if validation is bypassed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/download/epoch2x.rs] [Function: finish_downloads()] [Time Calculation] At line 2096, download time is calculated with saturating_sub - can overflow cause incorrect performance metrics? (Low)",
