  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: cost_map()] [Cost Validation] Does the high cost (n * 1210 + 3314) account for the mapped function's cost, or just iteration overhead? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: cost_pow()] [Critical Underpricing] Fixed cost u170 for exponentiation is dangerous - can attacker compute 2^1000000 for nearly free? (Critical)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: cost_set_entry()] [I/O Mismatch] Why is read_length u0 when read_count is u1 - does this correctly model read operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: cost_set_var()] [I/O Mismatch] Similarly, read_length u0 with read_count u1 - is this a bug or intentional? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: Multiple] [Consensus Split] If testnet costs differ from mainnet costs, can this cause cross-network replay or consensus issues? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: nlogn()] [Degenerate Case] For n=1, nlogn returns (a * 1 * 0 + b) = b - is this the intended minimum cost? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/costs-2-testnet.clar] [Function: Multiple] [Negative Costs] Can any formula produce negative costs through overflow, causing free or refunded execution? (Critical)",
