(Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/serialize.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Consensus Divergence] If the Cursor position() returns a value that equals data.len() but the decoder consumed extra padding bytes that were silently ignored, could this allow two different byte representations to deserialize to the same object, violating serialization determinism? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/serialize.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Consensus Divergence] Can the position check at line 199 be bypassed if a malicious ConsensusDecodable implementation manipulates the Cursor's internal position to match data.len() without actually consuming all bytes, allowing hidden data injection? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/serialize.rs] [Function: deserialize()] [Type Confusion] Since the function uses generic type T with ConsensusDecodable bound, can an attacker exploit type confusion by providing data that is valid for multiple types but has different consensus meanings, bypassing the full consumption check? (High)",
