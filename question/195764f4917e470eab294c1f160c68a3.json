  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnHeaderIPC] [Consensus Divergence] Can the height() method return inconsistent values across multiple calls for the same header, allowing different nodes to process the same header at different heights and causing chain fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnHeaderIPC] [Data Integrity] Does the header_hash() method guarantee deterministic output for the same header data, or could non-deterministic hashing lead to consensus divergence when different nodes compute different hashes? (Critical)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnHeaderIPC] [Type Safety] Does the [u8; 32] return type for header_hash() enforce Bitcoin's 32-byte hash format, or could implementations return incorrect hash lengths for other blockchains causing buffer overflows? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnBlockIPC] [Consensus Divergence] Can height() return a different value than header().height(), causing nodes to process the same block at different heights and fork the chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnBlockIPC] [Data Integrity] Is there enforcement that block() contains transactions corresponding to the header returned by header(), or could implementations return mismatched block/header pairs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnBlockIPC] [Type Safety] Does the Self::H: BurnHeaderIPC constraint guarantee that header() returns a valid BurnHeaderIPC, or could unsafe implementations bypass this with invalid headers? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnBlockIPC] [Race Condition] Can concurrent threads call height(), header(), and block() and receive non-atomic snapshots where block data doesn't match header data due to intermediate updates? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/burnchains/indexer.rs] [Trait: BurnchainBlockParser] [Consensus Divergence] Can parse() produce different BurnchainBlock results for the same input block depending on epoch_id, and could epoch_id manipulation cause chain forks? (Critical)",
