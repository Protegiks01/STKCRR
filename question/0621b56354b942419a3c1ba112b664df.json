  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Authentication Bypass] Can an attacker bypass authentication by sending a request without the 'authorization' header when self.auth is Some, potentially allowing unauthorized block proposal submissions? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Authentication Timing Attack] Does the plaintext comparison auth_header != password allow timing attacks to leak the password length and characters, enabling credential discovery? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Authorization Logic Error] If self.auth is None, the function returns Bad Request 400 - can an attacker exploit this to determine if the endpoint is enabled vs disabled, leaking configuration information? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Authentication State Confusion] Can an attacker manipulate the auth field between requests to cause authentication state confusion in concurrent requests? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: hex_deser_block()] [Deserialization DoS] Can an attacker send malformed hex strings that cause hex_bytes() to consume excessive CPU/memory during deserialization, leading to DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: hex_deser_block()] [Consensus Deserialization Bypass] Can an attacker craft bytes that pass NakamotoBlock::consensus_deserialize but violate consensus rules, causing nodes to accept invalid blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: parse_json()] [JSON Parsing DoS] Can an attacker send deeply nested or extremely large JSON payloads that cause serde_json::from_slice to consume excessive resources despite MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN check? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Content-Length Bypass] Can an attacker send a Content-Length header claiming small size but actual body exceeding MAX_PAYLOAD_LEN, bypassing size validation? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Shadow Block Detection Bypass] The check block_proposal.block.is_shadow_block() occurs after full deserialization - can this be exploited to DoS nodes before rejection? (Medium)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Mainnet/Testnet Confusion] The validation checks mainnet != chainstate.mainnet - can an attacker exploit timing between this check and actual block processing to cause network confusion? (High)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Block Version Downgrade] The code only emits a warning for mismatched block.header.version - can an attacker submit old version blocks that violate consensus rules but are still accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: validate()] [Version Override Vulnerability] The block.header.version is overridden after validation - can this cause the validated version to differ from the actual block version used in consensus? (Critical)",

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: check_block_builds_on_highest_block_in_tenure()] [Tenure Height Bypass] Can an attacker craft a block whose parent is not the highest in tenure but still passes validation through race conditions or cache inconsistencies? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: check_block_builds_on_highest_block_in_tenure()] [Parent Header Query Race] The code queries parent_header after highest_header - can concurrent block submissions cause TOCTOU issues where the highest changes between queries?

  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/postblock_proposal.rs] [Function: check_block_has_valid_parent()] [Tenure Start Malleability] For tenure-start blocks, the parent tenure check uses parent_header.consensus_hash - can an attacker manipulate this to build on wrong tenure? (Critical)",
