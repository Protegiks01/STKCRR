  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Data Integrity] Is there verification that the chunk version retrieved matches the requested slot_version to prevent returning stale or incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consistency] If get_latest_chunk() on line 136 is used when slot_version is None, how does the implementation handle concurrent writes that change the 'latest' between check and retrieval? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Protocol Correctness] Does retrieving chunk_data.data on line 132 properly extract only the payload without metadata that could leak internal state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] What happens if the contract name or address in the regex capture contains Unicode characters that are valid in regex but invalid in QualifiedContractIdentifier? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Edge Case] If a StackerDB chunk is exactly STACKERDB_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE bytes, could there be off-by-one errors in size validation or response construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] Can slot_id be 0, and if so, is this handled correctly as a valid slot identifier or does it indicate a parsing error? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: new_get_stackerdb_chunk()] [Edge Case] What happens if the slot_version is Some(0) - is version 0 a valid initial version or does it indicate an uninitialized slot? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Information Disclosure] Does the metrics identifier on line 61 leak sensitive information about request patterns that could be used for traffic analysis attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Type Safety] Does the error conversion on line 176 with response.try_into_contents().map_err(NetError::from) properly preserve all error context needed for debugging? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Memory Safety] Does HttpResponseContents::from_ram(chunk_resp) on line 187 efficiently handle large chunks near STACKERDB_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE without excessive memory copying? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Atomicity] Is the chunk retrieval atomic with respect to StackerDB updates, or could a partial write be observed if the chunk is being updated during the read? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Consistency] Does the implementation guarantee that if slot_version is specified, the exact version is returned or an error is given, never silently falling back to a different version? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Size Validation] Does the parse_bytes() call verify that the actual bytes received match the content-length header to detect truncation or padding attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Clone trait] [Resource Management] Does the Clone implementation on line 31 for RPCGetStackerDBChunkRequestHandler properly handle cloning of the Option fields without introducing aliasing issues? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does the new() constructor on lines 38-44 properly initialize all fields to a safe default state that won't cause panics or undefined behavior if used before try_parse_request()? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/getstackerdbchunk.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Propagation] Can the NetError::SendError created on lines 119 and 123 be distinguished from network transport errors to provide better error diagnostics? (Low)"
