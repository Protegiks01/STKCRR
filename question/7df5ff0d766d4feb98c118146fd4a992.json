  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 508-510] [Proof Construction] Does VRF::prove() call VRFProof::new() which validates check_c(), and what happens if the c_scalar somehow has non-zero upper bytes despite coming from ed25519_scalar_from_hash128()? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 509] [Error Logging] The code uses inspect_err() to log if the c scalar validation fails - but is this error case theoretically impossible if ed25519_scalar_from_hash128() works correctly, and should this be an unreachable! panic instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::prove()] [Alpha Validation] Does VRF::prove() validate the alpha message bytes before proof generation, or can arbitrary byte strings be used as VRF inputs without length/content restrictions? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::prove()] [Private Key Validation] Does VRF::prove() validate that the secret VRFPrivateKey is well-formed before starting proof generation, or could invalid private keys cause non-deterministic failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::verify()] [Verification Logic] Does VRF::verify() correctly implement ECVRF verification according to draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-02, and could any deviation cause valid proofs to be rejected or invalid proofs to be accepted? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 520] [Hash-to-Curve] Does VRF::verify() recompute H_point using hash_to_curve() with the same public key and alpha as proof generation, ensuring verification uses the correct challenge point? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 522-524] [Public Key Validation] Does VRF::verify() decompress the Y_point public key and validate it's a valid curve point, returning Error::InvalidPublicKey if decompression fails? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 525-527] [Gamma Validation] Does VRF::verify() check that proof.Gamma() is NOT a small-order point, preventing attackers from submitting proofs with torsion components that could pass verification incorrectly? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 529-530] [Verification Equations] Does VRF::verify() correctly compute U_point = s*B - c*Y and V_point = s*H - c*Gamma to verify the proof, and could sign errors in the subtractions cause verification to incorrectly accept/reject proofs? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 529] [Scalar Multiplication] The code computes s_reduced * ED25519_BASEPOINT_POINT - is this multiplication constant-time to prevent timing attacks during verification, or could verification timing leak information about the proof?

  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 533-535] [Scalar Conversion Error] What happens if ed25519_scalar_from_hash128() returns None when computing c_prime during verification - does this correctly reject the proof with Error::InvalidHashPoints? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 538] [Constant-Time Comparison] The code compares c_prime == proof.c() and relies on Scalar's constant-time comparison - but is the entire verify() function constant-time, or could early returns leak information about which validation check failed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::verify()] [Proof Malleability] Could an attacker modify a valid proof (Gamma, c, s) to produce a different proof that still verifies for the same (Y_point, alpha), enabling proof malleability attacks that violate uniqueness? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::verify()] [Alpha Validation] Does VRF::verify() validate the alpha message bytes before verification, or could providing different alpha values than those used in proof generation cause verification to spuriously succeed or fail? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Function: VRF::verify()] [Error vs Bool] The function returns Result<bool, Error> where Ok(true) means verified and Ok(false) means not verified - could callers mishandle Ok(false) as success, and should verification failure be an Err instead? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 521] [Proof Field Access] Does VRF::verify() access proof.s() which returns a reference to the s scalar - could modifications to this scalar between proof construction and verification cause inconsistent behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 211] [SUITE Constant] The SUITE constant is set to 0x03 for Ed25519-SHA512-Elligator2 - if this constant is changed, would all historical VRF proofs become invalid, causing a consensus fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Lines: 236] [Proof Size] VRF_PROOF_ENCODED_SIZE is set to 80 bytes - is this size correct for the encoding of (Gamma: 32, c: 16, s: 32), and could changing this constant break proof serialization? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/util/vrf.rs] [Prove-Verify Roundtrip] If VRF::prove() generates a proof for (secret, alpha), and VRF::verify() is called with (public_key, proof, alpha), is verification guaranteed to succeed if no errors occur, ensuring correctness of the VRF implementation?
