  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Epoch Mismatch] Can an attacker exploit epoch handling by querying variables from contracts deployed in earlier epochs with a clarity_tx configured for a later epoch, bypassing type safety checks or cost limits that differ between epochs? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Input Validation] Does get_data_var() validate that data_var on line 45 contains only valid Clarity identifier characters, or can special characters cause database key construction errors or cache poisoning? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [String Handling] Can data_var contain null bytes, Unicode control characters, or excessively long strings that cause buffer overruns or DoS in the underlying database key serialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Variable Lookup] If data_var matches a map name or NFT name instead of a variable name, does lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor correctly return NoSuchDataVariable, or could it access the wrong storage type? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Case Sensitivity] Is data_var lookup case-sensitive, and if so, can an attacker query with different casing (e.g., 'MyVar' vs 'myvar') to bypass cached lookups or trigger different error paths? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Error Handling] Can the pattern match on lines 52-54 fail to distinguish between NoSuchDataVariable (variable doesn't exist) and NoSuchContract (contract doesn't exist), causing get_data_var() to return Ok(None) in both cases when callers need to differentiate? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Error Mapping] If lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor returns a VmExecutionError that is NOT RuntimeCheck(NoSuchDataVariable), does line 55 correctly convert it to Err(ClarityError::Interpreter(e)), preserving all error context? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Error Semantics] Does mapping NoSuchDataVariable to Ok(None) create security issues where callers treat missing variables as having None/default values, when they should fail-fast to prevent incorrect state transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Type Error Handling] If the variable exists but its TypeSignature cannot be loaded or deserialized, does lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor return a specific error that get_data_var() can identify, or does it surface as a generic error? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Value Type] When get_data_var() returns Ok(Some(Value)) on line 51, is the Value guaranteed to match the variable's declared TypeSignature, or could epoch mismatches cause type confusion where a uint is returned as a buffer? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Deserialization] If the stored variable data is corrupted or truncated, does lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor detect this and return an error, or could it return a partially-deserialized Value that causes crashes on use? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Value Size] Can lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor return an unboundedly large Value (e.g., max-size buffer or string-utf8), causing memory exhaustion in callers that don't expect get_data_var() to allocate gigabytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Tuple Handling] If the variable is a tuple with nested optional types, can deserialization edge cases in different epochs cause some (some ...) values to become (none), corrupting the returned Value? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Transaction Isolation] Does with_clarity_db_readonly on line 48 guarantee that the epoch retrieved on line 47 and the variable lookup on line 50 see a consistent snapshot, or can the epoch change between these calls? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [State Consistency] If the contract code was recently modified (e.g., redeployed with same name), can get_data_var() observe the new contract's metadata but the old contract's variable data, leading to type mismatches? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Race Condition] If another transaction concurrently updates the data variable between begin() and rollback() in with_clarity_db_readonly, can get_data_var() return stale data that violates consensus invariants? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Rollback Safety] Does the rollback properly undo any MARF reads or cache updates performed by lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor, or could it leave dirty cache entries that affect subsequent lookups? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Unknown Descriptor] Why does get_data_var() use lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor instead of lookup_variable, and could the 'unknown descriptor' path bypass important type checking or cost accounting? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Descriptor Caching] Does lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor perform an extra database read to fetch the TypeSignature, and can repeated calls to get_data_var() cause O(n) descriptor lookups that should be O(1) with caching? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_data_var()] [Descriptor Validation] If the stored TypeSignature for the variable is malformed or inconsistent with the variable's actual data, does lookup_variable_unknown_descriptor detect this, or could it successfully deserialize garbage data? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Consensus Invariant] If get_contract() returns Ok(Some(contract)) for a given contract_id, is get_data_var() guaranteed to succeed for all variables declared in that contract's code, or can MARF inconsistencies cause get_data_var() to return Ok(None)? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Atomicity] If a contract deployment transaction is being processed and get_contract() is called before the transaction commits, can it observe a partially-initialized contract where the code exists but variables don't? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [MARF Consistency] Can MARF trie corruption cause get_contract() and get_data_var() to return inconsistent results for the same contract (e.g., contract exists but its variables are missing), breaking state invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Error Consistency] Do both functions use the same error mapping strategy (NoSuchX → Ok(None), others → Err), and could inconsistencies cause one function to error while the other succeeds for the same underlying issue? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/db/contracts.rs] [Function: get_contract(), get_data_var()] [Mutability] Why do both functions take &mut T instead of &T for clarity_tx on lines 28 and 43, and could the mutable reference allow callers to modify transaction state in ways that violate readonly semantics? (Medium)"
