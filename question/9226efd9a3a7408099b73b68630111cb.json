  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Overall Contract] [Consensus Divergence] Could differences in burn-block-height interpretation between nodes cause different claimable amounts to be calculated, leading to consensus divergence when claim() is executed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Overall Contract] [State Consistency] If multiple transactions in the same block call claim() and update-recipient(), can the order of execution cause state inconsistencies where claims go to the wrong recipient? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Function: calc-total-vested()] [Determinism] Is calc-total-vested deterministic for a given burn-height, or could environmental factors or node state cause different results on different nodes, breaking consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Overall Contract] [Economic Attack] Can an attacker economically benefit by manipulating the timing of claims relative to per-tenure mints, extracting value that should be reserved for future vesting periods? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Function: claim()] [Error Propagation] If validate-caller() fails with ERR_NOT_ALLOWED, is the error properly propagated up and does it prevent any state changes, or could partial execution occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Function: claim()] [Error Handling] If stx-transfer fails, does the try! properly abort the entire claim transaction, or could the print statement still execute, emitting a false-positive event? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Function: update-recipient()] [Error Recovery] If update-recipient() fails after var-set but before returning, can the recipient be left in an inconsistent state, and is there proper rollback? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/chainstate/stacks/boot/sip-031.clar] [Constant: ERR_NOTHING_TO_CLAIM] [Error Semantics] Is ERR_NOTHING_TO_CLAIM the correct error to return when claimable is zero, or could this mask other issues like balance being less than reserved? (Low)"
