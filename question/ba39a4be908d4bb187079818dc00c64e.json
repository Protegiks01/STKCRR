  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Stacking Protocol] Does the query correctly interpret 'reward cycle' boundaries per the PoX contract rules, or could off-by-one errors cause blocks from adjacent cycles to be counted? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Nakamoto] Are only Nakamoto-era blocks counted, or could pre-Nakamoto blocks (if using same public key format) be incorrectly included in the count? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [HTTP Smuggling] Does the content-length check at line 75 protect against HTTP request smuggling where a second request is hidden in the body of the first? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: verb()] [HTTP Method] Does the handler correctly reject non-GET requests, or could POST/PUT requests bypass validation by matching the path regex at line 56? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Query String] The query parameter at line 101 is extracted but never validated or used. Can an attacker inject malicious query strings that affect downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: path_regex()] [Path Traversal] Does the regex anchor `^` and `$` at line 57 prevent path traversal attacks like `/v3/signer/../../../etc/passwd/02{64 hex}/{cycle}`? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: metrics_identifier()] [Information Disclosure] Does the metrics identifier at line 63 leak information about specific signers or cycles being queried through telemetry? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Memory] Does with_node_state() at line 129 hold locks on chainstate for the entire database query duration, potentially blocking other operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Resource Leak] If an error occurs after line 129 but before line 145, are chainstate resources properly released, or could repeated errors cause resource exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: clone()] [Memory] The Clone derive on GetSignerRequestHandler at line 29 copies Option<Secp256k1PublicKey>. Can this lead to memory amplification if many handlers are cloned with large keys? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_response()] [Memory] Does parse_json at line 163 enforce limits on response size, or could a malicious peer send gigabyte-sized JSON responses causing OOM? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Struct: GetSignerRequestHandler] [Invariant] Can signer_pubkey at line 31 and reward_cycle at line 32 be in inconsistent states (one Some, one None), breaking the assumption that both are set together? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: new()] [Initialization] Does new() at line 36 create a handler in a valid state, or should it enforce that signer_pubkey and reward_cycle must be set before use? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Trait: Default] [Initialization] Can the Default implementation at line 29 create handlers that are used without proper initialization via try_parse_request()? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Type Safety] Does the ok_or() pattern at lines 120-127 properly convert None into NetError, or could the error string be misinterpreted by error handling code? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Authentication] Is there any authentication check on who can query signer block counts, or can any peer request statistics about any signer? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Authorization] Can querying signer block counts leak information about private stacking configurations or signer participation that should be access-controlled? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Public Key] Does the endpoint verify that the queried public key is actually a registered signer for the given cycle, or can arbitrary public keys be queried? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] Can cycle_num be 0, and if so, does this refer to the genesis reward cycle, or is 0 an invalid value that should be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] What happens if cycle_num at line 95 equals u64::MAX? Does downstream code handle this boundary value correctly without overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Edge Case] If blocks_signed is 0, does this mean no blocks were signed, or could it indicate a database query error that returned null/0 as a default? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/getsigner.rs] [Function: try_parse_request()] [Edge Case] Can the regex at line 56 match paths with trailing slashes like `/v3/signer/{key}/{cycle}/`, and if not, does this cause user confusion with 404 errors? (Low)",
