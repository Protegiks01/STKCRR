  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Read Operations Cost] With cost tracking disabled, could an attacker craft a contract call that performs extremely expensive read operations (e.g., scanning large maps or lists) that would normally exceed cost limits, causing DoS? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Time Limit Enforcement] The `max_execution_time` is set at line 236 - how accurate is this time measurement, and could an attacker exploit clock manipulation, scheduling delays, or busy-wait loops to exceed the intended time limit? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: new()] [Time Limit Configuration] The `read_only_max_execution_time` is passed as a parameter but there's no validation - could an administrator accidentally set this to an extremely large value (or Duration::MAX), effectively disabling DoS protection? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Concurrent Execution] There's no rate limiting or concurrency control visible in this file - could an attacker send many concurrent fast-call-read requests to exhaust server resources despite per-request time limits? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Time Check Granularity] The execution time check happens during Clarity VM execution - what's the granularity of time checks, and could an attacker exploit long gaps between checks to perform more work than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [TOCTOU Race Condition] The chain tip is loaded at line 181 and used later at line 222 - could the chain tip change between these operations, causing the execution to operate on stale or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Tip Not Found Handling] If `load_stacks_chain_tip` returns an error at line 183, it's converted to an error response - could an attacker trigger this condition repeatedly to DoS the node or probe its state? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [State Snapshot Consistency] The execution uses `maybe_read_only_clarity_tx` at line 221 - does this provide a consistent snapshot of the chainstate, or could concurrent block processing cause read inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Index Handle Safety] The sortition DB index handle is obtained at line 222 with `index_handle_at_block` - could this fail or return an invalid handle if the tip block is very recent or being reorganized? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [SymbolicExpression Conversion] Arguments are converted to SymbolicExpressions at lines 213-216 using `atom_value(x.clone())` - could this clone operation be expensive for large Values, and is there any size limit on individual Values? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Argument Lifetime] The arguments are collected into a vector of SymbolicExpressions - do these references remain valid throughout contract execution, or could they be invalidated by Clarity VM operations? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Mainnet/Chain ID] The execution environment uses `mainnet` and `chain_id` from chainstate at lines 218-219 - could these values be incorrect if called during a network upgrade or testnet/mainnet confusion? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Sender/Sponsor Context] The sender and sponsor are passed to the Clarity environment at lines 228-229 - could an attacker provide a sender/sponsor combination that grants unexpected privileges or bypasses access controls in the called contract? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Contract Call Depth] The comment at lines 241-243 mentions that using `read_only = false` allows `contract-call?` - could an attacker craft deeply nested contract calls that exceed stack limits or cause other recursion-related issues? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Cross-Contract Calls] Since the endpoint allows calling non-read-only functions and permits contract-call?, could an attacker trigger a chain of contract calls that collectively perform writes, even though the entry point appears read-only? (Critical)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Error Discrimination] The error handling at lines 270-292 treats different error types differently - could an attacker use error message differences to probe the internal state or execution path of contracts? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Write Count Zero Check] The check at line 274 specifically tests `actual_cost.write_count > 0` - what about write_length? Could a contract write zero-length data that doesn't increment write_count but still mutates state? (High)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [ExecutionTimeExpired Handling] When execution time expires at line 279, it returns a 408 Timeout - does this response reveal information about the node's performance or load that could be used for timing attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Generic Error Exposure] Non-specific errors at line 287 are returned with `e.to_string()` - could this expose sensitive internal details about contract state, execution paths, or node configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Ok(None) vs Err() Handling] Lines 293-300 treat both `Ok(None)` and `Err(_)` identically as",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Result Serialization] The successful result is serialized to hex at lines 260-262 using `serialize_to_hex()` - could extremely large return values cause memory exhaustion or response size limits to be exceeded? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Serialization Failure] If serialization fails at line 262, it returns a NetError - but the contract has already executed successfully. Could this create a state inconsistency if the execution had observable side effects (e.g., event emissions)? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Hex Encoding] The result is prefixed with",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: restart()] [State Cleanup] The restart function at lines 166-172 sets all fields to None - is this called between every request, and could a missing call leave stale data from a previous request? (Medium)",
  "[File: stackslib/src/net/api/fastcallreadonly.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Field Extraction] Fields are extracted using `.take()` at lines 188-208 - if restart() wasn't called or a field is already None, this would cause an error. Is there proper sequencing guaranteed? (Medium)"
