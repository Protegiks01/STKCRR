  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Callback Panics] If any callback (invoke_new_tenure, invoke_new_burn_chain_state, invoke_new_stacks_chain_state) panics, does it properly unwind state changes or leave the node in a corrupted state? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Sortdb Access] Callbacks receive sortdb references (e.g., line 221-222). Can callbacks modify sortition database state, affecting subsequent sortition outcomes? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Tenure Mutation] Does invoke_new_tenure() receive a mutable reference to the tenure at lines 159-164 allowing modification of consensus-critical tenure data (VRF proofs, block transactions) before execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Database Consistency] sortdb_mut() is called at lines 86, 105, 130, 179, 210 while sortdb_ref() is used elsewhere. Can mixing mutable and immutable access cause database lock contention, stale reads, or write skew anomalies? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Index Handle Validity] Is the sortition_id from burnchain_tip.block_snapshot used at lines 92, 141, 168, 222 always valid, or can it reference a sortition that was reorganized out, causing database lookup failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Stale Index] Between creating an index_handle at line 92 and using it in tenure.run(), can the sortition database be updated by burnchain.sync(), making the index stale? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Network Race] spawn_peer_server() at line 68 starts network threads before genesis processing completes. Can peers send blocks/transactions that get processed before genesis state is properly initialized? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Peer Isolation] Does the helium run loop properly isolate itself from network peers, or can remote peers inject blocks/transactions that interfere with the simulated burnchain coordination? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Incomplete Error Recovery] BurnchainControllerError is propagated at lines 51, 64, 109, 184, but tenure errors cause panics. Why is there inconsistent error handling, and can this lead to unrecoverable states? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Error State Corruption] If burnchain.sync() returns an error mid-loop, does the code leave partial state changes (uncommitted artifacts, updated chain_tip, modified round_index) that corrupt subsequent iterations?

  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/run_loop/helium.rs] [Function: start()] [Off-by-One] The loop starts with round_index = 1 at line 150, but the equality check at line 152 uses ==. Should this be >= to ensure we don't skip the final round or run one extra round? (Low)",
