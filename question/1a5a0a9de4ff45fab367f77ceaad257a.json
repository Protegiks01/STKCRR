  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Replay Attack] The request ID on line 190 is caller-provided with no uniqueness enforcement - if the caller reuses IDs across different requests, can responses for old requests be replayed and accepted as responses to new requests, causing stale burnchain data to be processed? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [Configuration Error] If the timeout parameter on line 149 is set to None and uses the 30-second default (line 165), is this timeout sufficient for all Bitcoin RPC operations during network congestion or when fetching large block data, or can legitimate requests timeout causing unnecessary retry storms? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: new()] [DNS Rebinding] When the URL is parsed on line 155 and the host is extracted on line 156, is the host resolved immediately or later during send()? If DNS resolution is delayed and the attacker controls DNS, can DNS rebinding cause the node to connect to a different IP address than initially validated? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [TLS Bypass] The code uses StacksHttpRequest on line 204 but there's no visible TLS/HTTPS enforcement - if the URL scheme is 'http' instead of 'https', are Bitcoin RPC credentials and burnchain data transmitted in plaintext, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks to inject false data? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Certificate Validation] When connecting to an HTTPS Bitcoin RPC endpoint via send_http_request() on line 220, are TLS certificates properly validated, or can an attacker with a self-signed certificate perform MITM attacks and provide false burnchain information? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Concurrent Requests] If multiple threads call send() concurrently on the same RpcTransport instance, is send_http_request() on line 220 thread-safe, or can race conditions in the underlying HTTP client cause response mixing where one thread receives another's response? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Resource Leak] After send_http_request() on line 220, if the response parsing fails at any point (lines 221-241), are the network resources and response body properly cleaned up, or can repeated failures cause file descriptor or memory leaks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Error Propagation] When various errors are returned (lines 202, 209, 220, 224, 227, 230, 234, 240), do the calling functions in the burnchain module properly distinguish between recoverable and fatal errors, or can transient network issues be treated as consensus failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Const: RPC_VERSION] [Protocol Downgrade] The RPC_VERSION constant on line 38 is hard-coded to '2.0' - if a Bitcoin RPC server supports multiple JSON-RPC versions and the version sent in requests affects response semantics, can an attacker force the use of an older version with known vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: send()] [Integer Overflow] When the params vector on line 193 is serialized to Value::Array on line 199, is there a check on the array length, or can an attacker provide billions of parameters that cause integer overflow in size calculations or memory allocation failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-node/src/burnchains/rpc/rpc_transport/mod.rs] [Function: build_req_path()] [Unicode Handling] The strip_prefix() call on line 258 and string operations on lines 259-262 handle Unicode strings - can an attacker use Unicode normalization attacks (e.g., different representations of the same character) to bypass path validation or create path confusion? (Medium)"
