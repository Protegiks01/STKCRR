  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureinfo.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Invalid Block ID Construction] What happens if StacksBlockId::new() at line 107 is called with a zero or invalid consensus_hash, and can this cause downstream validation failures or consensus divergence? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureinfo.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block Hash Mismatch] Can network.parent_stacks_tip.block_hash at line 109 be a sentinel value (all zeros) during genesis or chain initialization, causing invalid parent_tenure_start_block_id construction? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureinfo.rs] [Function: try_handle_request()] [Block ID Collision] Can different combinations of consensus_hash and block_hash at lines 107-109 and 111-113 produce the same StacksBlockId, causing tenure confusion? (High)",

  "[File: stacks-core/stackslib/src/net/api/gettenureinfo.rs] [Struct: RPCGetTenureInfo] [Tenure Start Block Exposure] Can exposing tenure_start_block_id at line 46 allow attackers to predict which blocks will be tenure starts, enabling targeted mining attacks or censorship? (Medium)",
