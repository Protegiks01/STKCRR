  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: nonce] [Consensus Divergence] Can an attacker send a VersionMessage with nonce value 0, and would this be accepted as valid, potentially allowing self-connection or loop detection bypass since 0 is a valid u64 but may not be properly validated as a unique identifier? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: nonce] [DoS] If multiple peers send VersionMessages with identical nonce values, can this cause improper peer deduplication or connection tracking failures, allowing an attacker to establish multiple connections that appear as a single peer? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: nonce] [Network Partitioning] Can an attacker observe nonce values from legitimate VersionMessages and replay them to cause loop detection false positives, forcing nodes to reject valid peer connections? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Consensus Divergence] Can an attacker send a VersionMessage with a negative timestamp value (since timestamp is i64), and would this cause integer underflow in timestamp comparison logic, potentially affecting peer synchronization or node time adjustment? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Time-based Attacks] Can an attacker send VersionMessages with timestamp set to i64::MAX (9223372036854775807), causing overflow when performing time delta calculations or comparisons with current system time? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [Time-based Attacks] Can an attacker send VersionMessages with timestamp set to i64::MIN (-9223372036854775808), causing the node to incorrectly calculate time differences or accept connections from nodes claiming to be from the distant past? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: timestamp] [DoS] If timestamp validation allows arbitrary future timestamps, can an attacker send VersionMessages with timestamps far in the future, potentially causing nodes to adjust their local time incorrectly or skip timestamp validation for subsequent messages? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [DoS] Since user_agent is a String with no explicit length limit in the struct definition, can an attacker send a VersionMessage with an extremely large user_agent string (e.g., multiple gigabytes) to cause memory exhaustion or allocation failures during deserialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [Parsing] Does the String deserialization for user_agent properly validate UTF-8 encoding, and can an attacker send malformed UTF-8 sequences that cause parsing errors, panics, or consensus divergence between nodes with different UTF-8 validation strictness? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [DoS] Can an attacker send a user_agent string containing null bytes (0x00) or special control characters that could cause issues in logging, string processing, or downstream parsing that assumes null-terminated strings? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [Resource Exhaustion] If user_agent strings are stored per-peer for the connection lifetime, can an attacker open many connections with maximum-length user_agent strings to cause memory exhaustion on the node? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: user_agent] [Injection] Can an attacker inject specially crafted user_agent strings containing format specifiers (%s, %d, etc.) or ANSI escape codes that could be exploited if the user_agent is logged or displayed without proper sanitization? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: version] [Downgrade Attack] Can an attacker send a VersionMessage with version = 0, and would this be accepted, potentially causing the node to negotiate a minimal or non-existent protocol version that lacks security features? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: version] [Consensus Divergence] If the version field uses u32 but protocol negotiation logic expects version numbers to fit in smaller types (u16 or i32), can an attacker send version = u32::MAX to cause integer truncation or wraparound in version comparison logic? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: version] [Protocol Confusion] Can an attacker send version values that are valid u32 but represent future protocol versions not yet implemented, causing the node to accept connections with undefined behavior or skip validation checks that assume known version semantics? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: services] [Protocol Confusion] Can an attacker send a VersionMessage with services = 0, advertising no capabilities, and still successfully establish a connection that expects certain service flags to be set, bypassing service-based routing or filtering logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: services] [Feature Bypass] Can an attacker set arbitrary high-order bits in the services field (e.g., bits 32-63) that are reserved or undefined, causing undefined behavior in bitflag checking or allowing the attacker to claim support for non-existent services? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: services] [DoS] If services field validation requires specific service bits to be set, can an attacker send contradictory service flags (e.g., claiming both pruned and full node status) to cause validation logic errors or inconsistent peer classification? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: start_height] [Sync Manipulation] Since start_height is i32 and can be negative, can an attacker send start_height = i32::MIN (-2147483648) to manipulate block synchronization logic that uses height comparisons, potentially causing the node to skip sync or sync from invalid peers? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: start_height] [Consensus Divergence] Can an attacker send start_height = -1 to indicate unknown or invalid height, and would this be treated differently than start_height = 0, potentially causing inconsistent peer selection or fork choice during initial block download? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: start_height] [Integer Overflow] If start_height is used in arithmetic operations (e.g., calculating block range to sync), can an attacker send start_height = i32::MAX to cause integer overflow when adding block counts or height deltas? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: start_height] [Resource Exhaustion] Can an attacker advertise an extremely high start_height (e.g., i32::MAX) to cause the node to allocate excessive resources for tracking blocks or computing sync ranges, or to bypass pruning/rate-limiting logic that assumes reasonable heights? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: relay] [Protocol Bypass] Since relay is deserialized as a bool from u8 (any non-zero value becomes true), can an attacker send relay values other than 0 or 1 (e.g., 0xFF) that serialize differently than they deserialize, causing consensus divergence if the field is re-serialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: relay] [DoS] If relay=false is meant to opt-out of transaction relay but is not properly enforced, can an attacker connect with relay=false and still send transaction messages, bypassing rate limits or filtering that assumes relay=false peers won't send transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-common/src/deps_common/bitcoin/network/message_network.rs] [Field: receiver] [Parsing] Can an attacker send a VersionMessage with a malformed receiver Address (e.g., invalid IP encoding, Tor address, or corrupted port), and would this cause deserialization to fail gracefully or result in undefined behavior when the address is later used for connection management? (High)"
