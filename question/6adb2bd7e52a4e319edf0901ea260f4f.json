  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Burn Tip Change Race] check_burn_tip_changed() is called at the start, but can the tip change during block assembly, causing the miner to produce a block with stale burn view? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Epoch ID Query] The target_epoch_id is retrieved for burn_block.block_height + 1 - can off-by-one errors here cause the miner to use wrong epoch rules, creating consensus divergence? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Parent Burn View Compatibility] If parent_block_info.stacks_parent_header.burn_view is incompatible with mining_burn_handle, the error message logs but returns BurnchainTipChanged - could this mask different error conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Empty Block Production] When block_metadata.block.txs.is_empty(), the function returns NoTransactionsToMine - but could tenure change/coinbase-only blocks be incorrectly rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Miner Signature Generation] If mining_key.sign() returns an error, does the error handling properly abort, or could a block with invalid miner_signature be proposed? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Event Dispatcher Timing] process_mined_nakamoto_block_event() is called before signatures are gathered - could signers reject a block whose events were already dispatched, causing state inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Tenure Cost Update] tenure_cost is updated from block_metadata.tenure_consumed, but is this atomic with respect to concurrent tenure extend checks? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Mock Mining Nonce Manipulation] In mock mining mode, last_block_mined is manipulated based on parent consensus hash - could this logic create invalid nonce sequences in the mock miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Replay Transactions] If config.miner.replay_transactions is true but coordinator.get_signer_global_state() returns stale replay set, could duplicate transactions be included? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: mine_block()] [Signer Bitvec Length] signer_bitvec_len is derived from reward_set.rewarded_addresses.len() - can this length mismatch with actual signer set, causing signature verification failures? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Tenure Blocks Overflow] previous_tenure_blocks uses u32::try_from() which panics on overflow - can a tenure with >u32::MAX blocks cause node crash? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Nonce Sequencing] coinbase_nonce is current_miner_nonce, and coinbase uses current_miner_nonce + 1 - if tenure change tx fails, does coinbase tx get stuck with wrong nonce? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [BlockFound Late Flag] When reason is BlockFound with late=true, does the function correctly issue both BlockFound and Extended tenure changes, or could late blocks skip the Extended tx? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Extended Tenure Length] When reason is Extended, get_nakamoto_tenure_length() is called - can reorgs cause this length to be incorrect, leading to wrong previous_tenure_blocks value? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Read Count Extend Cause] For ReadCountExtend, the cause is set to TenureChangeCause::ExtendedReadCount - are validators prepared to handle this cause, or could old nodes reject these blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Parent Tenure Consensus Hash] prev_tenure_consensus_hash comes from parent_tenure_info - if this parent is later orphaned, does the tenure change tx become invalid? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Last Block Mined Check] If last_block_mined is Some but mined_blocks is 0, could this inconsistency cause incorrect tenure extend behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: make_tenure_start_info()] [Pubkey Hash Validation] tenure_change_payload uses keychain.get_nakamoto_pkh() - is this public key hash validated against the registered VRF key to prevent key substitution? (Critical)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_full_tenure_extend()] [Replay Mode Bypass] When config.miner.replay_transactions is true, the function always returns true - can an attacker force replay mode to prevent tenure timeouts? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_full_tenure_extend()] [Cost Threshold Calculation] proportion_largest_dimension() is used for usage calculation - can this proportion calculation underflow or overflow, causing incorrect tenure extend decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_full_tenure_extend()] [Tenure Extend Timestamp Race] tenure_extend_timestamp is compared with get_epoch_time_secs() - can clock skew between nodes cause some to accept tenure extends that others reject? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_full_tenure_extend()] [Tenure Timeout Bypass] If tenure_change_time.elapsed() wraps around due to system clock changes, could this bypass the tenure_timeout check? (Medium)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_full_tenure_extend()] [First Block Check] If last_block_mined.is_none(), function returns false - but what if the first block mining failed and we need to extend before second attempt? (Low)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_read_count_extend()] [Read Count Division] The usage calculation divides by read_count/100 - can read_count < 100 cause division by zero or incorrect usage percentages? (High)",
  "[File: stacks-core/stacks-node/src/nakamoto_node/miner.rs] [Function: should_read_count_extend()] [Max Clamping] std::cmp::max(1, self.tenure_budget.read_count / 100) prevents division by zero, but can tenure_budget.read_count = 0 still cause incorrect extend decisions? (Medium)"
